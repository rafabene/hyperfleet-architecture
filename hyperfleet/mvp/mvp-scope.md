**Date**: October 31, 2024
**Status**: Approved
**Source**: Leadership Presentation

---

## Executive Summary

Leadership has approved the HyperFleet MVP with the following key decisions:
- **Timeline**: 12-week handover-ready MVP 
- **Cloud Provider**: GCP for MVP
- **Scope**: Full platform foundation with production-ready quality 

---

## Timeline (12 Weeks) 

**APPROVED: 12-week timeline for handover-ready platform**

### What We're Building
A **handover-ready platform** (not a prototype) that includes:
- Complete platform foundation (API, Sentinels, adapters, message broker)
- Cluster creation capability (clusters + node pools)
- Production-ready quality (tests, observability, CI/CD, documentation)
- Handover package (training, documentation, support plan)

### What This Means
- **Weeks 1-12**: Build handover-ready MVP with cluster creation capability
- **Week 13+**: Post-handover iteration by team
  - Full CRUD support (updates, deletion, patching)
  - Additional cloud providers (AWS FedRamp, etc.)
  - BU-specific features
  - Advanced capabilities (IDPs, autoscalers, etc.)

### Why 12 Weeks?
This is a **distributed system with 7+ services**, not a single application:
- API Service 
- 2 Sentinel deployments 
- Message broker integration 
- Adapter service framework
- 5+ cloud-specific adapters
- Testing, observability, documentation

## MVP Scope Alignment 

**APPROVED: handover-ready platform foundation**

### Core Platform Components

#### 1. HyperFleet API Service
**Scope**:
- Cluster lifecycle API (create, read, status)
- Node Pool lifecycle API (create, read, status)
- Status aggregation across all adapters
- REST API with OpenAPI specification
- Database schema and migrations

**Why This Scope**:
- Clusters AND node pools = complete resource model
- Status aggregation = core orchestration capability
- Both resources share same patterns = validate architecture thoroughly


---

#### 2. Sentinel Service
**Scope**:
- Cluster Sentinel (monitors cluster resources)
- Node Pool Sentinel (monitors node pool resources)
- CloudEvent generation and publishing
- Sharding support for scale
- Config-driven deployment

**Why Both Sentinels**:
- Validates sentinel pattern works for multiple resource types
- Tests sharding logic under realistic load
- Proves config-driven approach is reusable

**Key Design Features**:
- **Multiple Sentinels**: One per resource type (clusters, node pools)
- **Sharding**: Distributes load across sentinel instances to prevent API overload
- **Config-Driven**: Resource-agnostic framework reusable for all resource types
- **Backoff Strategies**: Different polling intervals for Ready vs Not Ready resources

---

#### 3. Message Broker Abstraction Layer
**Scope**:
- Abstraction layer for messaging patterns
- RabbitMQ for local development
- GCP Pub/Sub for production
- Fanout pattern implementation
- Dead-letter queue support

**Why Abstraction Layer**:
- Enables cloud provider flexibility
- Can switch messaging patterns without code changes
- Supports both GCP (Pub/Sub) and RabbitMQ equally
- Future-proof for messaging strategy evolution


**MVP Messaging Strategy**:
- Fanout pattern: Sentinel publishes, all adapters subscribe
- Each adapter receives every event and decides if it should act
- Simple, parallel execution, loose coupling

---

#### 4. Config-Driven Adapter Service
**Scope**:
- Single binary adapter service
- Configuration schema (preconditions, postconditions, templates)
- Multi-resource type support (clusters, node pools, etc.)
- Kubernetes resource lifecycle management
- Status reporting framework
- Retry and error handling
- Horizontal scaling support

**Why Config-Driven**:
- Build once, reuse for every adapter
- Cloud-agnostic implementation
- Extensible through configuration alone
- No code changes needed for new cloud providers

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Single Binary**: One adapter service, infinite configurations
- **Multi-Resource**: Handles clusters, node pools, any future resource type
- **K8s Lifecycle**: Creates and manages Jobs, Deployments, StatefulSets, ConfigMaps
- **Scale**: Handles high message volume from fanout pattern with horizontal scaling

---

#### 5. GCP Cluster Adapters (5 Adapters)
**Scope**: ~5 adapters for GCP cluster provisioning
1. **Validation Adapter** - Check GCP prerequisites
2. **DNS Adapter** - Create Cloud DNS records
3. **Placement Adapter** - Select region and management cluster
4. **Pull Secret Adapter** - Store credentials in Secret Manager
5. **HyperShift Adapter** - Create HostedCluster CR

**Additional**: Node pool adapters (count TBD)

**Per Adapter Requirements**:
- Configuration files (preconditions, postconditions, templates)
- GCP service integration and error handling
- Unit tests (80% coverage requirement)
- Integration tests (with GCP test environment)
- E2E tests (full cluster provisioning flow)
- Observability instrumentation (metrics, logs, traces)
- Documentation

**Why Each Adapter Takes Time**:
- Configuration is non-trivial (understanding full workflow)
- GCP integration has edge cases (quotas, rate limits, IAM issues)
- Testing requires real GCP environment
- Must be production-ready (handle all error cases, retries, timeouts)


---

### Production Readiness Requirements

#### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests**: Multiple components with mocked externals
- **E2E Tests**: Full system with real GCP

#### Observability
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for all components
- **Dashboard**:  Single Grafana dashboard for monitoring
- **Alerts**: Critical alert definitions
- **Logs**: Structured logging across all services

#### CI/CD
- **Helm Chart**: Deployment automation
- **Automated testing**: All tests run in CI
- **Security scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning

#### Documentation
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI specs, usage guides
- **Runbooks**: Operational procedures, troubleshooting guides
- **Architecture Documentation**: System design, component interactions
- **Training Materials**: Handover documentation for GCP team


---

### What's NOT in MVP Scope

These capabilities are deferred to **post-handover iteration (Week 13+)**:

#### Deferred Features
- **Full CRUD Operations**: Cluster/node pool updates, deletion, patching
- **Multiple Cloud Providers**: AWS FedRamp, other providers
- **Advanced Features**: IDPs, autoscalers, cost tracking, templates
- **BU-Specific Customizations**: Custom requirements from business units

**Why Deferred**:
- Validate architecture with single cloud first
- Deliver handover-ready foundation faster
- Learn from production usage before expanding
- GCP team continues iteration post-handover

---

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Design
- Loose coupling between components
- Parallel execution (adapters run simultaneously)
- Fault isolation (one adapter failure doesn't cascade)
- Easy to add/remove/modify adapters

### 2. Cloud-Agnostic Foundation
- API design independent of cloud provider
- Message broker abstraction supports multiple providers
- Adapter framework works for any cloud
- Config-driven approach eliminates code changes for new clouds

### 3. Production-Ready from Day One
- Comprehensive error handling
- Tests, observability, documentation included
- Secure, scalable, maintainable
- Can be operated and supported
- Foundation for the future (build on it, not throw it away)


---

## Risks and Mitigations

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Adapter failure and retry strategy** - Addressed with comprehensive config-driven retry logic
2. **Concurrent event handling** - Mitigated with horizontal scaling architecture
3. **Status condition schema** - Design validated early in foundation phase
4. **Database performance** - Upfront schema design and optimization 
5. **Configuration management** - Config-driven approach with validation

### Mitigation Strategy
- **Milestone checkpoints** at Weeks 4, 8, 12 with go/no-go decisions
- **2-week buffer** built into timeline
- **Parallel development** where possible (adapters, testing)
- **Early validation** of critical patterns (foundation phase)
