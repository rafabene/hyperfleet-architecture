# Spike Report: HyperFleet E2E Test Automation Run Strategy

**JIRA Story:** HYPERFLEET-532  
**Date:** Jan 30, 2026  
**Focus:** Deployment lifecycle management, resource isolation, and parallel Test Run execution safety

---

## 1. Problem Statement

HyperFleet E2E testing validates system-level behavior across multiple cooperating components, including:

- HyperFleet API
- Sentinel
- Adapter framework (multiple adapter types)
- Messaging broker (Topics / Subscriptions)

As E2E coverage expands and test pipelines begin executing in parallel, the current approach lacks a clearly defined **E2E test run strategy** to govern:

- Deployment lifecycle ownership
- Resource isolation boundaries
- Race condition prevention in concurrent executions
- Reliable cleanup and observability

This results in:

- Flaky test failures caused by shared resources
- Unclear ownership of deployed components
- Orphaned Kubernetes and broker resources
- Limited scalability of parallel pipelines

This spike defines a **comprehensive E2E test automation run strategy**, focusing on how tests are **deployed, isolated, coordinated, and cleaned up**, rather than on individual test case logic.

---

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Goals

This spike aims to define a strategy that:

- Enables **safe parallel execution** of multiple Test Runs
- Ensures **strong resource isolation** between test runs
- Clearly defines **deployment lifecycle ownership**
- Prevents race conditions by design
- Supports **config-driven framework testing** with fake adapters
- Improves **debuggability and maintainability**
- Establishes reusable patterns for future E2E expansion

---

### 2.2 Non-Goals

This spike explicitly does **not** cover:

- Individual test case implementation
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Performance or load testing considerations
- External environments not related to HyperFleet (such as cloud resources)

---

## 3. Core Design Principles

### 3.1 Test Run as the Primary Isolation Unit

All test infrastructure, configuration, and resources are scoped to a **single Test Run**.

A Test Run is the smallest unit of:

- Isolation
- Resource ownership

---

### 3.2 Explicit Lifecycle Ownership

Every component participating in E2E testing must have clearly defined ownership for:

- Setup
- Runtime management
- Teardown

Implicit or shared ownership is considered a design flaw.

---

### 3.3 Isolation Over Optimization

When trade-offs exist, this strategy prioritizes:

> Reliability, isolation, and debuggability over startup speed or resource reuse.

---

## 4. E2E Test Run Model

### 4.1 Test Run Definition

A **Test Run** represents one or more E2E test cases executed sequentially as a single unit.

Each Test Run has:

- A globally unique **Test Run ID**
- A well-defined lifecycle: `setup → execute → teardown`
- Exclusive ownership of all resources it creates

---

### 4.2 Test Run Identification

Each Test Run generates a unique identifier (Test Run ID) derived from:

- CI-provided environment variable (when available)
- Unix timestamp with high entropy
- Customized with random components

**Example**: Using `time.Now().UnixNano()` generates a 19-digit number: `1738152345678901234`, resulting in namespace: `e2e-1738152345678901234`.

The Test Run ID is consistently applied to:

- Kubernetes Namespaces
- Resource names
- Broker Topics and Subscriptions
- Labels and annotations

Namespaces are additionally labeled to indicate execution context:

- Label `e2e.hyperfleet.io/ci` distinguishes CI pipeline runs (`yes`) from local developer runs (`no`)
- Enables context-appropriate retention policies
- Does not affect test execution behavior

This ensures **traceability** and **collision avoidance**.

---

### 4.3 Test Run Lifecycle

Each Test Run follows a well-defined lifecycle:

```text
Create Namespace
      ↓
Deploy Infrastructure (helm)
      ↓
Infrastructure Ready
      ↓
Execute Test Suites
      ↓
Cleanup
```

**Step 1: Create Namespace**
- Create dedicated namespace: `e2e-{TEST_RUN_ID}`
- Apply isolation labels (see Section 5.4 for labeling strategy details)

**Step 2: Deploy Infrastructure** (via helm)
- Database (PostgreSQL, deployed with API)
- API and Sentinel
- Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
- Fake adapters (deployed with test-specific configurations)
- Pass `test_run_id` to helm deployment for resource tagging

**E2E Configuration Requirements**:
- All messaging resources (topics/subscriptions) must be tagged with `test_run_id` for cleanup
- Naming pattern: `{resource-name}-{test-run-id}` for resource isolation

**Infrastructure Ready** means:
- All infrastructure components are healthy
- Broker topics and subscriptions exist
- Fake adapters are operational and subscribed to topics
- Test suites can execute independently

**Test Suite Execution**:
- Suites execute sequentially
- Adapter Suite may hot-plug fake adapters as needed (for negative cases, edge cases)
- Environment state persists across suites within the same Test Run

**Cleanup**:
- Delete cloud messaging resources (topics/subscriptions) tagged with test_run_id
- Uninstall infrastructure components via helm
- Delete namespace
- See Section 9 for detailed cleanup and retention policy

---

### 4.4 Config-Driven Framework Testing

**Problem**: Core Suite needs to validate HyperFleet framework behavior (event flow, status aggregation) without external dependencies. How can we test the adapter framework effectively?

**Decision**: Deploy fake adapters with test-specific configurations

Deploy the adapter framework image multiple times (as separate Kubernetes Deployments) with different YAML configurations stored in the E2E repository. These **fake adapters** do not execute real business logic (no DNS creation, no real placement, etc.) but simulate adapter behavior to test the framework.

**Key Distinction**:
- **Not production adapters**: These adapters don't perform real operations (no cloud API calls, no actual cluster/nodepool provisioning)
- **Framework testing focus**: We test framework behavior (event routing, status aggregation), not adapter business logic
- **Config-driven simulation**: Different configurations simulate different adapter behaviors (success, failure, timeout, precondition failure, etc.)

**Rationale**:
- **Adapter framework is config-driven**: Adapter behaviors are defined via YAML configuration, not code (architecture design principle)
- **Configuration capabilities are comprehensive**: Preconditions (API calls, CEL expressions), Resources (K8s Job/Deployment manifests), Postconditions (CEL validation), Retry/Timeout strategies
- **Simpler than Fixture Adapter**: No custom code implementation needed for error injection - configs handle all scenarios
- **Aligned with framework design**: Leverages existing config-driven architecture
- **Version controlled**: Test configurations stored in E2E repository
- **No hot-plugging prerequisite**: All fake adapters deployed as infrastructure

**Test Scenario Examples via Configuration**:

| Test Scenario | Configuration Approach | Custom Code Needed? |
|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Success path | Preconditions pass → Job with `exit 0` → Available=True | ❌ No |
| Precondition failure | Preconditions fail → Applied=False | ❌ No |
| Job failure | Job with `command: ['sh', '-c', 'exit 1']` | ❌ No |
| Long-running workload | Job with `command: ['sleep', '120']` | ❌ No |
| Timeout | Config: `timeout: 5s` on long-running job | ❌ No |
| Complex validation | CEL expressions in postconditions | ❌ No |

**E2E Repository Structure**:
```
e2e-testing/
├── testdata/
│   └── adapter-configs/
│       ├── cluster-job/               # Cluster event creates Job workload
│       │   ├── adapter-config.yaml
│       │   ├── adapter-task-config.yaml
│       │   └── adapter-task-resource-*.yaml
│       ├── cluster-deployment/        # Cluster event creates Deployment workload
│       ├── cluster-namespace/         # Cluster event creates Namespace
│       └── nodepool-configmap/        # NodePool event creates ConfigMap
```

**Infrastructure Deployment**:
- Deploy multiple fake adapter instances (same framework image, different configs) using Kubernetes Deployments
- Each fake adapter instance subscribes to events independently
- All deployed as infrastructure (before tests execute)
- Test cases trigger events and verify framework behavior (not adapter business logic)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No custom Fixture Adapter code needed
- ✅ Uses adapter framework's config-driven capabilities
- ✅ Fast iteration (config changes vs. code compilation)
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage (all scenarios config-driven)
- ✅ Simpler architecture (no separate Fixture Adapter repository)
- ✅ Tests framework behavior (not adapter business logic)

---

## 5. Deployment Lifecycle Strategy

### 5.1 One Namespace per Test Run

Each Test Run is assigned a **dedicated Kubernetes Namespace**.

This Namespace serves as the hard isolation boundary for:

- API
- Sentinel
- Adapters
- Supporting services (databases, brokers, etc.)

**Rationale:**

- Eliminates cross-test interference
- Simplifies cleanup semantics
- Improves debugging clarity
- Avoids complex naming or locking schemes

---

### 5.2 Namespace Naming Convention

Namespace names follow a consistent pattern for operational clarity:

```text
e2e-{TEST_RUN_ID}
```

**Components**:
- `e2e-`: Prefix indicating E2E test resources
- `{TEST_RUN_ID}`: Unique test run identifier

**Rationale**:
- Test Run ID enables correlation of resources across test runs
- Operational teams can identify E2E namespaces without inspecting labels

---

### 5.3 Component Lifecycle Ownership

| Component          | Lifecycle Owner  | Scope        | Notes |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| Namespace          | Test Framework   | Per Test Run | |
| API                | Test Framework   | Per Test Run | |
| Sentinel           | Test Framework   | Per Test Run | Uses broker library to create topics/subscriptions |
| Broker Resources (Topics/Subscriptions) | Sentinel/Adapters | Per Test Run | Created via broker library, tagged with test_run_id |
| Fake Adapters (Core Suite) | Test Framework | Per Test Run | Deployed as infrastructure for normal scenarios |
| Fake Adapters (Adapter Suite) | Test Suite | Per Test Group or Test Case | Hot-plugged for negative/edge cases testing |

**Labeling/Tagging Rule:**

Resources are labeled based on cleanup requirements:

1. **Test Run Namespace**: Must be labeled (enables namespace discovery and retention policy)
2. **Resources within Test Run Namespace**: No labels needed (deleted automatically with namespace)
   - API, Sentinel, Fake Adapters (Deployments, Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.)
3. **Resources outside Test Run Namespace**: Must be labeled (require explicit cleanup)
   - Cloud messaging resources (Topics/Subscriptions managed by cloud provider)
   - Cluster namespaces created by adapters via kubectl (in same K8s cluster, different namespace)
   - Other cloud provider resources

**Rationale**: Only label resources that won't be automatically cleaned up by namespace deletion.

---

### 5.4 Resource Labeling Strategy

**Problem**: Which E2E test resources need labels for cleanup and traceability?

**Decision**: Only label resources that require explicit cleanup (outside test run namespace).

**Resources That Need Labels**:

| Resource Type | Location | Labels Required | Cleanup Method |
|---------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Test Run Namespace | Kubernetes | ✅ Yes | Namespace deletion |
| Resources in Test Run Namespace | Kubernetes (within namespace) | ❌ No | Auto-deleted with namespace |
| Cloud Topics/Subscriptions | Cloud provider | ✅ Yes | Cloud CLI with label filter |
| Cluster Namespaces (created by adapters) | Kubernetes (outside test run namespace) | ✅ Yes | kubectl delete with label selector |
| Other cloud resources | Cloud provider | ✅ Yes | Cloud CLI with tag filter |

**Required Labels** (for resources outside namespace):

1. `e2e.hyperfleet.io/test-run-id` - Unique Test Run identifier
2. `e2e.hyperfleet.io/ci` - Execution context (`yes` | `no`)
3. `e2e.hyperfleet.io/managed-by` - Ownership marker (`test-framework`)

**Kubernetes Resources Within Test Run Namespace**:
- API, Sentinel, Fake Adapters (Deployments, Pods, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- No labels needed - automatically deleted with namespace

**Rationale**:
- **Efficiency**: Only label resources that need explicit cleanup
- **Simplicity**: Namespace deletion handles most resources automatically
- **Cleanup precision**: Labels enable filtering for resources outside namespace
- **Cost control**: Ensures cloud resources are properly tracked and cleaned up

**Note**: Cloud provider resources use simplified tag names (e.g., `test_run_id`) due to platform restrictions on label format.

---

## 6. Resource Isolation Strategy

### 6.1 Kubernetes Resource Isolation

Isolation is achieved via:

- **Namespace-per-Test-Run**: Primary isolation boundary
- **Namespace labeling**: Test Run namespace labeled with `e2e.hyperfleet.io/test-run-id` (for discovery and retention)
- **Resources within namespace**: No additional labeling needed (auto-deleted with namespace)
- Optional but recommended `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange`

This prevents:

- Pod name collisions
- Service discovery conflicts
- Cross-test communication

**Note**: Only resources outside the test run namespace (e.g., cluster namespaces created by adapters) need explicit `e2e.hyperfleet.io/test-run-id` labels.

---

### 6.2 Messaging and Broker Isolation

Messaging resources (Topics / Subscriptions) are isolated using the Test Run ID.

Common patterns include:

- Run-scoped Topics
- Run-scoped Subscriptions
- Adapter-owned Subscription lifecycles

This avoids:

- Cross-test event delivery
- Subscription reuse race conditions
- Message leakage between runs

**Note**: See Section 9.5 for cloud messaging resource cleanup details.

---

## 7. Race Condition Prevention

Race conditions are prevented through **architectural isolation**, not runtime locking.

### 7.1 Unique Resource Identification

The Test Run ID ensures uniqueness across concurrent executions:

- **Namespace name**: `e2e-{TEST_RUN_ID}` (contains Test Run ID)
- **Namespace labels**: `e2e.hyperfleet.io/test-run-id={TEST_RUN_ID}` (for discovery)
- **Broker resources**: Topics/Subscriptions named `{resource-name}-{TEST_RUN_ID}` and tagged with `test_run_id`
- **Resources created by adapters outside namespace**: Labeled with `e2e.hyperfleet.io/test-run-id`

This guarantees uniqueness even under maximum concurrency.

**No Shared Mutable State**: The strategy explicitly avoids shared Namespaces, Topics/Subscriptions, databases, or API instances. Shared mutable state is the primary source of E2E race conditions.

**Note**: Resources within the test run namespace don't need explicit labels - they inherit isolation from the namespace boundary.

---

### 7.2 Parallel Test Run Execution Model

Parallel pipelines are safe because:

- Each Test Run executes within a sealed resource boundary
- No global locks are required
- Failures are contained within a single Namespace

---

## 8. Test Scenario Organization

### 8.1 Lifecycle Management Model

Test infrastructure is managed at the **Test Run level**, not per test case. Infrastructure is deployed once per Test Run and shared across all test suites (see Section 4.3 for lifecycle details and Section 5 for deployment strategy).

---

### 8.2 Test Suite Types

Test suites represent **validation focus**, not environment configurations.

#### 8.2.1 Core Suite

Validates HyperFleet framework behavior using fake adapters deployed with different configurations.

**Purpose**: Fast, stable testing of framework logic without external dependencies or real business logic.

**Environment**:
- Core components (API, Sentinel)
- Messaging infrastructure (topics/subscriptions created by broker library)
- Fake adapters deployed with test-specific configs (see Section 4.4)
- No external dependencies or real cloud services

**What We Test** (framework behavior, NOT adapter business logic):
- **Event flow**: API → Sentinel → Messaging → Adapter → API
- **Async status aggregation**: Framework waits for adapter responses
- **Status reconciliation**: Framework merges adapter conditions into resource status
- **Concurrent processing**: Framework handles multiple resources in parallel
- **Resource lifecycle**: Cluster and NodePool create/update/delete workflows

**Test Approach**:

Different fake adapters handle different event types, each with configuration defining simulated behavior:

| Framework Behavior | Fake Adapter Config | Simulated Behavior |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------|
| Basic data flow | `cluster-job` | Job exits 0 (simulates success) |
| Async aggregation | `cluster-job` (long-running variant) | Job sleeps 30s (simulates long operation) |

**Example Flow**:

```text
1. Test creates Cluster via API (cluster.created event published)
2. Fake adapter (cluster-job config) consumes event
3. Fake adapter evaluates preconditions (configured to pass)
4. Fake adapter creates Kubernetes Job (configured with 'exit 0' - simulates successful operation)
5. Job completes successfully
6. Fake adapter evaluates postconditions, reports Available=True to API
7. Test validates: Cluster phase = Ready
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Fast execution: No external dependencies, no real business logic
- ✅ Stable: Infrastructure deployed once, 100% reproducible
- ✅ Comprehensive: All framework scenarios covered via fake adapter configurations
- ✅ Focused: Tests framework only, not adapter implementation details

---

#### 8.2.2 Adapter Suite

Validates adapter framework's advanced features using fake adapters: negative cases, edge cases, and hot-plugging.

**Purpose**: Test framework's robustness and hot-plugging capabilities with complex scenarios that require adapter deployment/removal.

**Environment**:
- Core components deployed
- Fake adapters hot-plugged with **flexible deployment granularity** (managed by test groups or individual test cases)

**Validates** (framework advanced features, NOT business logic):
- **Hot-plugging functionality**: Dynamic adapter deployment and removal without restarting API/Sentinel
- **Negative cases**: Deployment failures, invalid configurations, error injection
- **Edge cases**: Timeout scenarios, resource conflicts, concurrent deployments
- Adapter removal and cleanup completeness
- Framework behavior under failure conditions

**Adapter Management Decision**:

We evaluated two deployment granularities for managing adapter lifecycle:

| Approach | Adapter Scope | When Deployed | When Removed | Trade-offs |
|----------|---------------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| **Test Group-level** (Ordered + BeforeAll/AfterAll) | Shared within a test group | Once per test group | After all tests in group | ✅ Faster (deploy once)<br>✅ Good for read-only tests<br>⚠️ Tests in group share adapter state |
| **Test Case-level** (BeforeEach/AfterEach) | Isolated per individual test | Before each test case | After each test case | ✅ Complete isolation<br>✅ No state pollution<br>✅ Required for negative cases<br>❌ Slower (deploy per test) |

**Decision: Support both granularities within Adapter Suite**

**Rationale**:
- Different test types have different isolation needs
- Basic validation tests (e.g., verify adapter registered) benefit from Test Group-level sharing
- **Negative cases** (e.g., error injection, deployment failures, invalid configs) require Test Case-level isolation
- **Hot-plugging validation** requires testing deployment and removal per case
- Edge cases need complete isolation to avoid state contamination
- Mixed approach optimizes for both speed and test quality

**Test Organization**:
- Test groups use scoped `Describe` blocks to control adapter lifecycle
- Test Group-level: `Describe` + `Ordered` + `BeforeAll`/`AfterAll`
- Test Case-level: `Describe` + `BeforeEach`/`AfterEach`
- Multiple test groups can coexist with different strategies

---

### 8.3 Suite Execution Order

**Recommended Order**:

Within a Test Run, suites typically execute in this order:

1. **Core Suite** - Validates framework data flow (normal scenarios)
2. **Adapter Suite** - Validates framework advanced features (negative cases, edge cases, hot-plugging)

**Rationale**:
- Core Suite runs first to validate basic framework functionality
- Core Suite provides fast feedback on infrastructure and normal flows
- Adapter Suite tests complex scenarios and hot-plugging after basic validation

**Flexibility**:
- Suites can run independently if infrastructure is ready
- Multiple Test Runs can execute in parallel, each isolated in separate namespace (e2e-{TEST_RUN_ID})

---

### 8.4 Test Organization Guidelines

**Problem**: When should tests use Test Group-level vs Test Case-level adapter deployment?

**Decision Matrix**:

| Test Characteristics | Recommended Strategy | Rationale |
|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Basic validation (adapter registration, health checks) | Test Group-level | Tests don't interfere, share setup cost |
| Hot-plugging validation | Test Case-level | Must test deployment and removal per case |
| Negative cases (deployment failures, error injection) | Test Case-level | State contamination risk, need fresh adapter |
| Edge cases (timeouts, conflicts, race conditions) | Test Case-level | Unpredictable state, need isolation |
| Configuration variations | Test Case-level | Different adapter configs required |

**Conceptual Structure**:

```go
Describe("Adapter Suite", func() {

  // Test Group 1: Shared fake adapter (Test Group-level)
  Describe("Basic Validation", Ordered, func() {
    var adapter *FakeAdapter
    BeforeAll: Deploy fake adapter once
    It: Test adapter registration with framework
    It: Test subscription to topics
    It: Test health reporting
    AfterAll: Remove adapter
  })

  // Test Group 2: Isolated fake adapters (Test Case-level) - NEGATIVE CASES
  Describe("Negative Cases", func() {
    var adapter *FakeAdapter
    BeforeEach: Deploy fresh fake adapter
    It: Test deployment with invalid config (should fail gracefully)
    It: Test error injection and framework recovery
    It: Test deployment failure handling
    AfterEach: Remove adapter
  })

  // Test Group 3: Isolated fake adapters (Test Case-level) - EDGE CASES
  Describe("Edge Cases", func() {
    var adapter *FakeAdapter
    BeforeEach: Deploy fresh fake adapter
    It: Test timeout scenarios
    It: Test concurrent adapter deployments
    It: Test resource conflicts
    AfterEach: Remove adapter
  })

  // Test Group 4: Hot-plugging validation (Test Case-level)
  Describe("Hot-plugging Lifecycle", func() {
    var adapter *FakeAdapter
    BeforeEach: Deploy fake adapter (test hot-plug deployment)
    It: Verify framework detects new adapter
    It: Verify adapter subscribes to events dynamically
    It: Verify adapter processes events without restart
    AfterEach: Remove adapter (test hot-plug removal)
  })
})
```

**Key Principles**:
- **Test Group-level** (Describe + Ordered + BeforeAll/AfterAll): Basic validation tests that share adapter
- **Test Case-level** (Describe + BeforeEach/AfterEach): Required for negative cases, edge cases, and hot-plugging
- **All use fake adapters**: No real business logic, focus on framework behavior under complex scenarios
- **Scoped test groups**: Each Describe block defines a focused scope for adapter lifecycle management

---

### 8.5 State Management and Suite Independence

Test isolation is achieved through namespace-level separation (Test Run isolation) and adapter lifecycle management (Test Group or Test Case isolation). Each Test Run executes in its own namespace (`e2e-{TEST_RUN_ID}`), ensuring complete separation of infrastructure resources.

**State Ownership Model**:

Test Run state is categorized by lifetime and ownership:

| State Type | Lifetime | Owner | Examples |
|------------|----------|-------|----------|
| Infrastructure State | Test Run | Test Framework | Namespace, API, Sentinel, Fake Adapters (Core Suite) |
| Hot-plugged Adapter State | Test Group or Test Case | Test Group (Describe block) | Fake adapters deployed/removed by Adapter Suite |
| Test Data | Test Case | Test Case | Clusters, NodePools, test-specific resources |

**Isolation Principles**:

1. **Infrastructure persists** - Core components and fake adapters (Core Suite) remain active throughout the Test Run
2. **Hot-plugged fake adapters are ephemeral** - Adapter Suite dynamically deploys/removes fake adapters per test group or test case
3. **Test data is scoped** - Each test case manages its own test resources
4. **Unique naming prevents collision** - Resources use unique identifiers to avoid cross-test interference

**Suite Independence**:

- Suites can run independently if infrastructure is ready
- Suite execution strategy:
  - **Fail-fast**: Core suite failures (API, Sentinel, Messaging) block dependent suites
  - **Fail-tolerant**: Independent suite failures are collected without blocking independent suites
  - Ensures early termination on infrastructure failures while maximizing test coverage
- Each suite validates its prerequisites at startup

**Cleanup Responsibility**:

- Test cases and suites clean their own state (hot-plugged fake adapters, test data)
- Infrastructure cleanup handled by Test Framework (see Section 9 for retention policy)

---

## 9. Resource Management and Cleanup

### 9.1 Cleanup Ownership Model

Cleanup is a shared responsibility between two actors:

1. **E2E Test Flow**: Responsible for setting retention policy and deleting passed tests
2. **Reconciler Job**: Responsible for enforcing TTL and handling edge cases

No single component owns all cleanup. This separation prevents single points of failure.

---

### 9.2 Retention Policy

#### 9.2.1 Default Retention (Safe Fallback)

All namespaces are annotated with a default retention policy at creation:

- **Default TTL**: 2 hours from creation
- **Purpose**: Safety net if E2E flow is interrupted or fails before updating retention
- Ensures orphaned namespaces are automatically cleaned up

#### 9.2.2 Test Result-Based Retention

E2E flow updates namespace retention annotations based on test outcome:

| Test Result | CI Context | Local Context | Retention |
|-------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Passed** | Any | Any | 10 minutes |
| **Failed** | `e2e.hyperfleet.io/ci=yes` | - | 24 hours |
| **Failed** | `e2e.hyperfleet.io/ci=no` | `e2e.hyperfleet.io/ci=no` | 6 hours |

**Rationale**:
- Passed tests have minimal debugging value → short retention conserves quota
  - 10-minute window prevents race conditions between E2E flow and reconciler deletion
- Failed tests need retention for post-mortem
  - CI (24h): Global team across time zones
  - Local (6h): Developer actively investigating
- Default 2h retention: Covers interrupted E2E flows

#### 9.2.3 Retention Override

Environment-based configuration allows overriding default retention policy.

**Use Cases**:
- Extended debugging sessions
- Demonstration environments
- Manual investigation

Override values are stored in namespace annotations for reconciler consumption.

---

### 9.3 Cleanup Reconciliation

#### 9.3.1 Reconciler Responsibilities

A scheduled reconciler job enforces TTL-based cleanup:

- Runs periodically (frequency configurable, typically 30 minutes)
- Scopes to namespaces labeled as E2E test framework managed
- Deletes namespaces based on retention annotation expiry

**Simplicity Principle**: Reconciler does not distinguish between:
- Normal vs orphaned namespaces
- CI vs local runs

All policy decisions are encoded in namespace annotations. Reconciler is stateless.

---

### 9.4 Orphaned Resource Handling

**Definition**: Orphaned resources occur when E2E flow is interrupted before setting final retention.

**Handling**:
- No special orphan detection needed
- Default 2-hour retention set at creation covers this case
- Reconciler treats orphans identically to any expired namespace

**Monitoring**: High orphan rate (inferred from default retention deletions) indicates E2E flow reliability issues.

---

### 9.5 Cloud Resource Cleanup

**Scope**: Cloud messaging resources (GCP Pub/Sub Topics and Subscriptions) require explicit cleanup beyond namespace deletion.

**Creation** (during infrastructure deployment):
- Topics/subscriptions auto-created during helm deployment
- All resources tagged with `test_run_id` for cleanup tracking

**Cleanup Process** (during teardown):

1. **Delete cloud resources FIRST**:
   - Delete topics/subscriptions filtered by `test_run_id` tag
   - Example (GCP): `gcloud pubsub topics delete --filter="labels.test_run_id=1738152345678901234"`
   - Example (GCP): `gcloud pubsub subscriptions delete --filter="labels.test_run_id=1738152345678901234"`
2. **Then helm uninstall** (removes all infrastructure components)
3. **Finally delete namespace**
4. **Reconciler**: Periodically scans for orphaned cloud resources (tagged but older than retention TTL) and deletes them

**Why This Order**:
- Cloud resources deleted **before** namespace deletion (cleanup script needs cluster access)
- Kubernetes namespace deletion does not remove cloud resources
- Cloud resources incur costs and quota consumption

---

## 10. Testing Infrastructure Considerations

### 10.1 Image Build and Distribution

**Image Architecture**:

Test infrastructure uses two container images with distinct responsibilities:

1. **Cloud Platform Tools** - Target cluster authentication
   - Contains cloud provider CLIs (gcloud, aws, etc.)
   - Runs as init container to generate cluster credentials
   - Low change frequency (rebuilt only when cloud tooling updates)

2. **E2E Test Framework** - Infrastructure deployment and test execution
   - Contains helm CLI, test code, and deployment charts
   - Manages entire Test Run lifecycle
   - High change frequency (rebuilt on test code or chart changes)

**Rationale**:
- Infrastructure deployment is orchestrated by Test Framework
- Fake adapter configurations stored in E2E repository enable config-driven testing
- Separation by change frequency optimizes CI/CD build efficiency

---

## 11. Observability and Debugging

Debuggability is enabled by:

- One Namespace per Test Run
- Consistent labeling and naming conventions
- Clear lifecycle boundaries
- Namespace retention on failure
- Component version reporting

**Version Transparency**:

Test framework outputs component versions at Test Run start:
- Core components (API, Sentinel)
- Fake adapters (framework image version + config checksums)
- Hot-plugged fake adapters (logged when Adapter Suite deploys/removes them)

Version information is logged during infrastructure deployment phase, enabling correlation between test results and component versions for failure investigation.

Engineers can:

- Inspect all failed-test resources in a single Namespace
- Correlate logs, events, and message flows
- Reproduce failures with exact component versions
- Identify version-specific issues

---

## 12. Action Items and Next Steps

Implementation follows a phased approach to establish e2e testing infrastructure with config-driven framework validation.

- [ ] Implement Core Suite test cases (framework behavior validation, NOT business logic)
- [ ] Test success path with cluster-job fake adapter
- [ ] Test precondition failure scenarios
- [ ] Test job failure scenarios
- [ ] Test async processing with long-running workloads
- [ ] Test timeout handling
- [ ] Validate framework data flow: API → Sentinel → Messaging → Fake Adapter → API
- [ ] Add infrastructure health validation

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: E2E Test Run Strategy Guide**
- [ ] Document Test Run lifecycle for developers
- [ ] Document config-driven testing approach with fake adapters
- [ ] Clarify Core Suite vs Adapter Suite (normal scenarios vs complex scenarios, both use fake adapters)
- [ ] Document fake adapter configuration patterns for different test scenarios
- [ ] Document Core Suite organization
- [ ] Document cleanup and troubleshooting

### 12.2 Phase 2: Adapter Suite (Future)

**Goal**: Implement Adapter Suite for framework advanced features testing: negative cases, edge cases, and hot-plugging.

**Prerequisites**: Requires HyperFleet system to support runtime adapter hot-plugging (dynamic adapter deployment without API/Sentinel restart).

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: Adapter Suite - Fake Adapter Configs for Complex Scenarios**
- [ ] Create fake adapter configs for negative cases (invalid config schemas, missing required fields)
- [ ] Create fake adapter configs for edge cases (timeout scenarios, resource conflicts)
- [ ] Create fake adapter configs for hot-plugging validation
- [ ] Document configuration patterns for simulating complex failure scenarios

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: Adapter Suite - Test Implementation**
- [ ] Implement flexible adapter deployment strategies (Ordered + BeforeAll/AfterAll, BeforeEach/AfterEach)
- [ ] Write hot-plugging validation tests (deploy and remove fake adapters dynamically without restart)
- [ ] Write negative case tests (deployment failures, invalid configs, error injection)
- [ ] Write edge case tests (timeouts, concurrent deployments, resource conflicts)
- [ ] Validate framework behavior under failure conditions
- [ ] Add cleanup completeness verification
- [ ] Implement mixed strategy examples (Test Group-level for basic validation, Test Case-level for negative/edge cases)

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: E2E Test Run Strategy Guide (Phase 2)**
- [ ] Write suite organization guide (Core Suite for normal scenarios vs Adapter Suite for complex scenarios)
- [ ] Document test organization strategies (Ordered + BeforeAll, BeforeEach/AfterEach, mixed approach)
- [ ] Document when to use Test Group-level vs Test Case-level deployment
- [ ] Clarify both suites use fake adapters (different scenarios, not different adapter types)
- [ ] Document hot-plugging validation patterns
- [ ] Document negative case and edge case testing patterns

### 12.3 Post-MVP Enhancements

The following enhancements are deferred to post-MVP:

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: Retention Policy**
- [ ] Implement namespace retention annotation logic
- [ ] Add test result-based retention updates (passed: 10min, failed: 24h/6h)
- [ ] Configure default 2-hour TTL for orphaned namespaces
- [ ] Write retention policy unit tests

**HYPERFLEET-XXX: Cleanup Reconciler Job**
- [ ] Implement TTL-based namespace reconciler
- [ ] Add orphaned resource detection and cleanup
- [ ] Add orphaned cloud resource cleanup (topics/subscriptions filtered by test_run_id tag)
- [ ] Configure reconciler schedule (30-minute default)
- [ ] Add reconciler monitoring and alerts
