## Overview

The Postgres desire store runs on the hub cluster. The Adapter is co-located with it, while each Applier runs on a separate OCI management cluster. This spike evaluates how remote Appliers access the Postgres-backed desire store and how to prevent cross-partition access. OCI-only deployment is the current requirement; multi-cloud portability is a future concern covered by ADR-0019.

## Options Evaluated

| Dimension | API-mediated access | Direct Postgres access |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Postgres exposure | Remains inside the hub cluster | Requires a cross-cluster network path |
| Authentication | Requires a cross-cluster identity design through Envoy and Authorino | Requires database credentials, mTLS, cloud IAM, or a credential broker |
| Partition isolation | Enforced once in server-side application code | Requires row-level security, per-cluster credentials, or client enforcement |
| Client coupling | Stable service contract | Postgres schema and connectivity details |
| Availability | Hub API service is on the path | Postgres is directly on the path |

## Recommendation

Use API-mediated access. It keeps Postgres inside the hub cluster and centralizes partition enforcement. [ADR-0022](../adrs/0022-api-mediated-desire-store-access.md) records the selected architecture, including the gateway authentication and partition-scoping requirements.

## Latency and Availability

Appliers poll every 5s, based on the load-modeling assumption from [HYPERFLEET-1432](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HYPERFLEET-1432). Same-region OCI latency is expected to leave sufficient headroom for the additional network hop, but implementation load testing must validate this at production concurrency.

The hub API service becomes a dependency for desire reads and status writes. This is the same hub failure domain that Sentinel already depends on for cluster and NodePool state. Client timeout, retry, and degraded-mode behavior remain implementation work.

## Decision

Adopt API-mediated desire-store access. The resulting architectural decision and its consequences are recorded in [ADR-0022](../adrs/0022-api-mediated-desire-store-access.md).

## Open Questions

The remaining service-design questions, including cross-cluster identity, partition binding, endpoint semantics, availability behavior, hosting, transport, gateway capacity, and defense in depth, are tracked in [HYPERFLEET-1645: Design the desire-store API service and cross-cluster Applier identity](https://redhat.atlassian.net/browse/HYPERFLEET-1645).

- **OCI security constraints**: Confirm OCI-specific restrictions that affect the hub cluster's internal Postgres deployment. This does not block the API-mediated path.
