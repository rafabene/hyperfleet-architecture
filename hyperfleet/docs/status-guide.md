## Overview

Comprehensive guide to the HyperFleet cluster status JSON structure and the adapter status reporting contract. Explains the condition-based status model (Available, Applied, Health), how adapter statuses are aggregated into cluster-level status, and how Sentinel uses status to make reconciliation decisions. The authoritative reference for implementing status reporting in adapters.

HyperFleet uses a **condition-based status reporting contract** where adapters report their progress through standardized Kubernetes-style conditions. This guide explains:

1. **The REST API** - Endpoints for reading and updating cluster status
2. **The Adapter → API Contract** - Required payload structure for status updates
3. **The Three Required Conditions** - Available, Applied, Health
4. **How to Read Cluster Status** - Interpreting aggregated cluster state
5. **Common Patterns** - Polling, error handling, progress tracking

## REST API Summary

### Resource Hierarchy

```text
/v1/clusters/{clusterId}                    # Cluster resource (with aggregated status)
/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses           # Adapter statuses (paginated AdapterStatusList)
```

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **GET** | `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}` | Get cluster with aggregated status conditions (`Reconciled`, `LastKnownReconciled`) |
| **GET** | `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses` | Get paginated `AdapterStatusList` with detailed per-adapter statuses |
| **PUT** | `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses` | Adapter reports status (API handles upsert internally) |

> **Note**: For how adapters build these payloads from declarative configuration (CEL-expression-based condition rules, event handling, and status reporting), see the [Adapter Status Contract](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/components/adapter/framework/adapter-status-contract.md) in the adapter framework component docs.

### Adapter Status Reporting Flow

When an adapter needs to report its status, it **always PUTs**. The API handles the upsert logic internally.

#### Adapter Action: PUT Status Report

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",           // Identifies which adapter is reporting
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:02:00Z",  // When adapter checked (now())
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobSucceeded",
      "message": "Job completed successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "Job created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "Adapter is healthy"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "validationResults": {
      "route53ZoneFound": true,
      "s3BucketAccessible": true
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "job_name": "validation-cls-123-gen1"
  }
}
```

**Response**: `201 Created` with the persisted `AdapterStatus` object, or `204 No Content` if the report was silently discarded (stale generation or timestamp).

**What Happens (API-side)**:

1. API receives PUT with `adapter` field identifying which adapter is reporting
2. API validates the request: mandatory conditions (Available, Applied, Health) present, `observed_time` within acceptable range
3. API finds the existing `AdapterStatus` for this adapter (or creates one if first report)
4. If first report: API creates the `AdapterStatus` with `created_time = now()`
5. If subsequent report: API updates the `AdapterStatus`, preserving `created_time`
6. API maps `observed_time` to the stored `last_report_time` field
7. API recalculates aggregated resource conditions: `Reconciled` (all required adapters Available=True at current generation) and `LastKnownReconciled` (sticky cross-generation signal)
8. API generates per-adapter `{AdapterName}Successful` conditions from each adapter's Available status
9. If the resource is soft-deleted, aggregation switches to requiring `Finalized=True` instead of `Available=True`

### Adapter Implementation Pattern

**Simple Pattern** (recommended - API handles upsert internally):

```javascript
function reportStatus(clusterId, adapterStatus) {
  // Adapter always PUTs - API decides if INSERT or UPDATE
  PUT /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses
  body = {
    adapter: "dns",              // Identifies which adapter
    observed_generation: 1,
    observed_time: now(),        // When adapter checked
    conditions: [...],
    data: {...}
  }

  // API returns 201 Created or 204 No Content (if stale)
}
```

**Why this pattern?**

- **Adapter simplicity**: No GET/POST/PATCH logic needed
- **Idempotent**: Safe to retry on failures
- **API encapsulation**: Upsert logic is API's internal implementation detail
- **Clear responsibility**: Adapter reports, API persists

**Note**: The `adapterStatus` object includes `observed_generation` which tells the API what generation of the cluster spec this adapter has reconciled.

---

## The Adapter Status Contract

### Reporting Status: Always PUT

Adapters **always PUT** to report status. The API handles upsert internally (INSERT if first report, UPDATE if adapter already reported).

**Endpoint**: `PUT /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`

**Payload Structure**: Adapters send just their status with `adapter` field identifying themselves:

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",           // Identifies which adapter is reporting
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:02:00Z",   // When adapter checked (now())
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobSucceeded",
      "message": "Job completed successfully after 115 seconds"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "Kubernetes Job created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "AllChecksPassed",
      "message": "All validation checks passed"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "validationResults": {
      "route53ZoneFound": true,
      "s3BucketAccessible": true,
      "quotaSufficient": true
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "job_name": "validation-cls-123-gen1",
    "duration": "115s"
  }
}
```

**API Response**: `201 Created` with the persisted `AdapterStatus` object, or `204 No Content` if the report was discarded (stale generation or timestamp)

**Note**: No `generation` field on ClusterStatus itself. Each adapter reports its own `observed_generation`.

### CRITICAL: Always Update `observed_time`

**Required Behavior**: Adapters MUST update their status on EVERY evaluation, regardless of whether they take action or skip work.

**Why This Matters**:

Sentinel's decision logic reads the resource's single aggregated `Reconciled` condition and republishes a reconciliation event when the resource isn't yet reconciled and `Reconciled.last_updated_time` hasn't advanced recently (see [How Sentinel Actually Detects Staleness](#how-sentinel-actually-detects-staleness)) — it does not track any individual adapter's `last_report_time`. `Reconciled.last_updated_time` only advances when an adapter's PUT causes the API to recompute it. If an adapter never reports at all — even when it has no work to do — the resource can never reach `Reconciled: True`, so Sentinel keeps republishing on its debounce window, and *every* subscribed adapter (not just the one that stopped reporting) keeps re-evaluating its own preconditions for no reason:

```text
Time 10:00 - DNS adapter receives reconciliation event
Time 10:00 - DNS checks preconditions: Validation adapter not complete
Time 10:00 - DNS does NOT update status (skips work)
            ❌ Reconciled has no new report to recompute from — stays False
Time 10:10 - Reconciled is still False and last_updated_time is >10s old (debounce window)
Time 10:10 - Sentinel publishes ANOTHER event for the resource
Time 10:10 - DNS (and every other subscribed adapter) receives the event AGAIN, checks preconditions AGAIN...
            ↻ Repeats every debounce window until validation completes and DNS starts reporting
```

**Correct Behavior - Update Status Even When Skipping Work**:

When an adapter evaluates a cluster but determines it should not take action (preconditions not met), it MUST still report status:

```json
{
  "adapter": "dns",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T10:00:00Z",  // ← CRITICAL: Update timestamp even when skipping work
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "PreconditionsNotMet",
      "message": "Waiting for validation adapter to complete"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "PreconditionsNotMet",
      "message": "Waiting for validation adapter"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "Adapter is healthy"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Integration Testing Requirement**:

Integration tests for adapters MUST verify:

- ✅ Adapter sets `observed_time` to current time when preconditions are met and work is performed
- ✅ Adapter sets `observed_time` to current time when preconditions are NOT met and work is skipped
- ✅ The resource's `Reconciled` condition recomputes (and its `last_updated_time` advances) whenever this adapter reports, even if the adapter's own status hasn't changed

**Reference**: See the Sentinel architecture documentation for details on the max age strategy and reconciliation loop.

### Building Status Payloads via Adapter Configuration

Adapters built on the [Adapter Framework](../components/adapter/framework/adapter-frame-design.md) generate this status payload declaratively rather than via custom code: a CEL-expression-based configuration evaluates resource state to compute each condition (`Applied`, `Available`, `Health`), and a reporting action PUTs the resulting payload to the HyperFleet API. See [Configuration-Based Status Building](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/components/adapter/framework/adapter-status-contract.md#configuration-based-status-building) in the Adapter Status Contract for the current schema and worked examples.

### Status Response Structure

Status in HyperFleet has two tiers:

1. **Aggregated status** (`ClusterStatus`) is embedded in the Cluster resource at `cluster.status`. It contains only computed `ResourceCondition` entries (`Reconciled`, `LastKnownReconciled`, `{AdapterName}Successful`). You cannot write to it directly.
2. **Adapter statuses** are returned by `GET /clusters/{id}/statuses` as a paginated `AdapterStatusList`. Each item is an individual `AdapterStatus` object.

```json
GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/cls-550e8400/statuses

{
  "page": 1,
  "size": 2,
  "total": 2,
  "items": [
    {
      "adapter": "validation",
      "observed_generation": 1,

      ],
      "data": {
        "validationResults": {
          "route53ZoneFound": true,

      "last_report_time": "2025-10-17T12:05:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### ClusterStatus Fields (aggregated, embedded in Cluster resource)

> **Schema Reference**: See [ClusterStatus schema definition](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api-spec/blob/main/schemas/core/openapi.yaml) in the API spec for complete field definitions, types, and validation rules.

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `conditions` | **YES** | array | Aggregated `ResourceCondition` entries computed by the API |

Mandatory conditions (present from resource creation):

- `Reconciled`: True when the resource's desired state has been fully reconciled by all adapters at the current generation
- `LastKnownReconciled`: Sticky cross-generation condition. Stays True as long as all required adapters were reconciled at a common observed generation, even if a newer generation is being processed

Per-adapter conditions (added as adapters report):

- `{AdapterName}Successful`: True when the adapter's `Available` condition is True. `{AdapterName}` is PascalCased by uppercasing only the first letter of each hyphen-separated segment of the adapter name — it does not uppercase whole acronyms. So the `dns` adapter produces `DnsSuccessful`, not `DNSSuccessful`.

### AdapterStatus Fields (returned by GET /statuses)

> **Schema Reference**: See [AdapterStatus schema definition](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api-spec/blob/main/schemas/core/openapi.yaml) in the API spec for complete field definitions, types, and validation rules.

| Field | Required | Type | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| `adapter` | **YES** | string | Adapter name (e.g., "validation", "dns") |
| `observed_generation` | **YES** | integer | Resource generation this adapter reconciled |
| `conditions` | **YES** | array | `AdapterCondition` entries (typically: Available, Applied, Health, Finalized) |
| `data` | **NO** | object | Adapter-specific structured data |
| `metadata` | **NO** | object | Job execution metadata (`job_name`, `job_namespace`, `attempt`, `started_time`, `completed_time`, `duration`) |
| `created_time` | **YES** | timestamp | When this adapter status was first created (API-managed) |
| `last_report_time` | **YES** | timestamp | When this adapter last reported (API-managed, updated every PUT) |

**Key Points**:

- `GET /clusters/{id}/statuses` returns a paginated `AdapterStatusList`, not a single object
- `ClusterStatus` is a computed sub-object on the Cluster resource (read-only). It has no `id`, `type`, or `href` of its own.
- Each `AdapterStatus` is independent. `observed_generation` indicates which resource generation the adapter reconciled.
- Cluster spec has `generation` (user's intent), adapters report `observed_generation` (observed state)
- Adapters always PUT with `adapter` field in payload. The API handles upsert internally.
- `last_report_time` is API-managed and updated on every PUT, even if conditions haven't changed. Sentinel uses it to detect adapter liveness.
- `last_transition_time` appears on conditions in GET responses but is API-managed. Adapters do not send it in PUT requests.
- The Cluster object contains only aggregated status (see below)

---

## The Three Required Conditions

Every adapter status update **MUST** include these three conditions. The API returns `400 Bad Request` if any of the three are missing from the PUT request.

### 1. Available

**Purpose**: Has the adapter completed its work successfully?

**Important**: The adapter aggregates this value based on all its other conditions

**Meaning**:

- `True` - Adapter finished successfully, all requirements met
- `False` - Adapter failed, incomplete, or still in progress

**Examples**:

```json
// Success
{
  "type": "Available",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "JobSucceeded",
  "message": "Validation Job completed successfully"
}

// Failure
{
  "type": "Available",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "JobFailed",
  "message": "Validation failed: Route53 zone not found for domain example.com"
}

// In Progress
{
  "type": "Available",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "JobRunning",
  "message": "Validation Job is still executing"
}
```

### 2. Applied

**Purpose**: Has the adapter created/applied the Kubernetes resources it needs?

**Meaning**:

- `True` - Resources created successfully (Job launched, ConfigMap applied, etc.)
- `False` - Failed to create resources or not yet attempted

**Examples**:

```json
// Job Created
{
  "type": "Applied",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "JobLaunched",
  "message": "Kubernetes Job 'validation-cls-123-gen1' created successfully"
}

// Creation Failed
{
  "type": "Applied",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "ResourceQuotaExceeded",
  "message": "Failed to create Job: namespace quota exceeded"
}

// Not Yet Attempted
{
  "type": "Applied",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "PreconditionsNotMet",
  "message": "Waiting for validation to complete"
}
```

### 3. Health

**Purpose**: Did anything unexpected or concerning happen?

**Meaning**:

- `True` - No unexpected errors, adapter is healthy
- `False` - Unexpected error occurred (retries exhausted, resource not found, etc.)

**Key Point**: Health is about **unexpected errors**, not business logic failures.

**Examples**:

```json
// Healthy (even if validation fails business logic)
{
  "type": "Health",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "AllChecksPassed",
  "message": "Adapter executed normally without errors"
}

// Unhealthy (unexpected error)
{
  "type": "Health",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "UnexpectedError",
  "message": "Failed to connect to Kubernetes API after 3 retries"
}

// Unhealthy (resource missing)
{
  "type": "Health",
  "status": "False",
  "reason": "ResourceNotFound",
  "message": "Job 'validation-cls-123-gen1' not found in cluster"
}
```

---

## The Finalized Condition (Deletion Lifecycle)

When a resource is soft-deleted (i.e., `deleted_time` is set), adapters participate in the deletion lifecycle by reporting a `Finalized` condition. This condition is **optional** during normal provisioning but becomes critical during deletion.

### How Finalized Works

1. Resource is soft-deleted via the API (sets `deleted_time`)
2. Sentinel publishes reconciliation events for the soft-deleted resource
3. Each adapter performs its cleanup work (delete Jobs, DNS records, etc.)
4. Each adapter reports `Finalized: True` at the current generation via PUT
5. Once **all** required adapters report `Finalized: True`, the API hard-deletes the resource from the database

### Aggregation Behavior

The `Reconciled` aggregated condition changes meaning based on deletion state:

- **Normal lifecycle** (no `deleted_time`): `Reconciled=True` when all required adapters have `Available=True` at current generation
- **Deletion lifecycle** (`deleted_time` set): `Reconciled=True` when all required adapters have `Finalized=True` at current generation, and no child resources remain (e.g., no nodepools for a cluster)

### Example: Adapter Reporting Finalized

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/cls-123/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "dns",
  "observed_generation": 2,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T13:00:00Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "CleanupComplete",
      "message": "DNS records deleted successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "ResourcesRemoved",
      "message": "All DNS resources cleaned up"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "Adapter is healthy"
    },
    {
      "type": "Finalized",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "CleanupComplete",
      "message": "Adapter has completed all deletion cleanup"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Key Points

- `Finalized` is **not** in the mandatory set (Available, Applied, Health are mandatory). Missing `Finalized` is treated as "not finalized" (same as `False`).
- Adapters only need to report `Finalized` when handling deletion events. During normal create/update flows, omit it.
- The API triggers hard-delete only when the final adapter's PUT includes `Finalized=True` and all other required adapters have already finalized.
- For clusters, hard-delete also requires that no child nodepools remain (`ReconciledWaitingForChildren` reason if nodepools still exist).
- If an adapter fails to report `Finalized` and the resource is stuck in Finalizing state, operators can use the force-delete endpoints (`POST /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/force-delete` or `POST /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/nodepools/{nodepoolId}/force-delete`) as an escape hatch (requires a `reason` for audit).

---

## Additional Conditions (Optional)

Adapters **MAY** send additional conditions beyond the three required ones. These can provide more granular status information.

### Rules for Additional Conditions

1. **All conditions must be positive assertions**
   - GOOD: `DNSRecordsCreated` (status: True/False)
   - BAD: `DNSRecordsNotCreated` (confusing when status: False)

2. **Adapter aggregates all conditions to determine Available**
   - If any condition is False, Available should be False
   - If all conditions are True, Available should be True

### Example: DNS Adapter with Additional Conditions

This example shows an adapter status payload (what gets PUT to the API and persisted as an `AdapterStatus` object):

```json
{
  "adapter": "dns",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:05:00Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "AllRecordsCreated",
      "message": "All DNS records created and verified"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "DNS Job created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "DNS adapter executed without errors"
    },
    // Additional conditions
    {
      "type": "APIRecordCreated",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "Route53Updated",
      "message": "Created A record for api.my-cluster.example.com"
    },
    {
      "type": "AppsWildcardCreated",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "Route53Updated",
      "message": "Created wildcard record for *.apps.my-cluster.example.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Aggregation Logic**:

- If any sub-condition is `False`, `Available` should be `False`
- If all sub-conditions are `True`, `Available` should be `True`
- Default to `False` if no other conditions exist

---

## The Data Field (Optional)

The `data` field is a **JSONB object** that adapters can use to send structured information beyond conditions.

### When to Use Data

- Detailed results that don't fit in condition messages
- Structured information for debugging
- Resource identifiers (VPC IDs, IAM role ARNs, etc.)
- Metrics and timing information

### Examples

**Validation Adapter Data**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "validationResults": {
      "route53": {
        "zoneId": "Z1234567890ABC",
        "zoneName": "example.com",
        "found": true
      },
      "s3": {
        "bucketName": "hyperfleet-clusters",
        "accessible": true,
        "region": "us-east-1"
      },
      "quotas": {
        "vpcLimit": 5,
        "vpcUsed": 2,
        "sufficient": true
      }
    },
    "checksPerformed": 15,
    "checksPassed": 15,
    "checksFailed": 0
  }
}
```

**Control Plane Adapter Data**:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "resources": {
      "vpcId": "vpc-123abc456def",
      "subnetIds": ["subnet-111", "subnet-222", "subnet-333"],
      "securityGroupId": "sg-789ghi",
      "natGatewayId": "nat-012jkl"
    },
    "timing": {
      "vpcCreation": "12s",
      "subnetCreation": "8s",
      "totalTime": "45s"
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Cluster and Status Objects

The HyperFleet API provides two endpoints for cluster information:

- **GET** `/v1/clusters/{id}` - Cluster resource with metadata and aggregated status
- **GET** `/v1/clusters/{id}/statuses` - Detailed adapter statuses (paginated `AdapterStatusList`)

### Cluster Object Structure (with Aggregated Status)

**GET** `/v1/clusters/{id}`

Returns the complete cluster resource including metadata, spec, and aggregated status:

> **Schema Reference**: See [ClusterStatus Fields](#clusterstatus-fields-aggregated-embedded-in-cluster-resource) above for the full field list — this example shows a fully-reconciled cluster; see [Complete Cluster Scenarios](#complete-cluster-scenarios) for how these conditions evolve over the provisioning lifecycle.

### Accessing Detailed Status

To see detailed conditions, data, and health information for ALL adapters:

**GET** `/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`

This returns a paginated `AdapterStatusList` (`{page, size, total, items}`) containing one `AdapterStatus` entry per adapter. You can then filter client-side for the specific adapter you need. Because `items` is page-local, keep fetching subsequent pages until the adapter is found or all pages are exhausted.

Each item in the `items` array includes its `observed_generation` field, indicating which cluster generation that adapter has reconciled.

### Check If Adapter Completed

To determine if an adapter has completed successfully:

1. Fetch adapter statuses: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`, following pagination until found or all pages are exhausted
2. Find the adapter by `adapter` name in the returned `items`
3. Check `observed_generation === cluster.generation` (not stale)
4. Check the `Available` condition's `status === "True"`

### Check Adapter Health

To check adapter health, you need the detailed `AdapterStatus` object:

1. Fetch: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`, following pagination until found or all pages are exhausted
2. Find the adapter by `adapter` name in the returned `items`, filtering client-side on `observed_generation` if you need a specific generation
3. Find the `Health` condition in that adapter's `conditions`
4. Check if `status === "True"`

If `Health: False`, examine the `message` and `data` fields for debugging details.

---

## Complete Status Lifecycle Examples

The following examples show **individual adapter status payloads** that adapters send. These become individual `AdapterStatus` items retrievable via `GET /statuses`.

> **Implementation Note**: Adapters generate these payloads using the declarative configuration described in [Building Status Payloads via Adapter Configuration](#building-status-payloads-via-adapter-configuration).

### 1. Adapter Started (Job Created)

**Scenario**: Validation adapter received event, created Job. This is the first adapter to report. The API will create a new `AdapterStatus` object for it.

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/cls-123/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:05Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "JobRunning",
      "message": "Validation Job is executing"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "Kubernetes Job 'validation-cls-123-gen1' created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "Adapter is healthy"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "job_name": "validation-cls-123-gen1",
    "job_namespace": "hyperfleet-jobs"
  }
}
```

**What This Means**:

- Job created successfully (Applied: True)
- Job is running (Available: False - not yet complete)
- No errors (Health: True)

---

### 2. Adapter Succeeded

**Scenario**: Validation Job completed successfully. Validation adapter PUTs to update its status (API handles upsert).

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/cls-123/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:02:00Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobSucceeded",
      "message": "Job completed successfully after 115 seconds"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "Kubernetes Job created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "AllChecksPassed",
      "message": "All validation checks passed"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "validationResults": {
      "route53ZoneFound": true,
      "s3BucketAccessible": true,
      "quotaSufficient": true,
      "iamPermissionsValid": true
    },
    "checksPerformed": 15,
    "checksPassed": 15,
    "executionTime": "115s"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "job_name": "validation-cls-123-gen1",
    "completed_time": "2025-10-17T12:02:00Z"
  }
}
```

**What This Means**:

- Job created (Applied: True)
- Job succeeded (Available: True)
- No errors (Health: True)
- Detailed results in `data` field

**Next Steps**: DNS adapter can now proceed (validation complete)

---

### 3. Adapter Failed (Business Logic)

**Scenario**: Validation Job ran but found missing Route53 zone

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/cls-123/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:02:00Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "ValidationFailed",
      "message": "Route53 zone not found for domain example.com. Create a public hosted zone before provisioning the cluster."
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "JobLaunched",
      "message": "Kubernetes Job created successfully"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "True",
      "reason": "NoErrors",
      "message": "Adapter executed normally (validation logic failed, not adapter error)"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "validationResults": {
      "route53ZoneFound": false,
      "s3BucketAccessible": true,
      "quotaSufficient": true
    },
    "checksPerformed": 15,
    "checksPassed": 14,
    "checksFailed": 1,
    "failedChecks": ["route53_zone"]
  }
}
```

**What This Means**:

- Job created (Applied: True)
- Validation failed (Available: False)
- Adapter is healthy (Health: True) - **validation failure is expected behavior**

**Key Point**: `Health: True` because the adapter worked correctly. The validation *logic* failed (missing DNS zone), but the adapter itself had no errors.

---

### 4. Adapter Failed (Unexpected Error)

**Scenario**: Adapter couldn't create Job due to quota exceeded.

**PUT** `/v1/clusters/cls-123/statuses`

```json
{
  "adapter": "validation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "observed_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:05Z",
  "conditions": [
    {
      "type": "Available",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "ResourceCreationFailed",
      "message": "Failed to create validation Job"
    },
    {
      "type": "Applied",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "ResourceQuotaExceeded",
      "message": "Failed to create Job: namespace resource quota exceeded (cpu limit reached)"
    },
    {
      "type": "Health",
      "status": "False",
      "reason": "UnexpectedError",
      "message": "Adapter could not complete due to resource quota limits"
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "error": {
      "type": "ResourceQuotaExceeded",
      "message": "CPU limit reached",
      "namespace": "hyperfleet-jobs"
    }
  }
}
```

**What This Means**:

- Job NOT created (Applied: False)
- Work incomplete (Available: False)
- Adapter unhealthy (Health: False) - **unexpected error prevented normal operation**

**Key Point**: `Health: False` because this is an unexpected infrastructure issue, not expected business logic.

---

### Complete AdapterStatusList Example

Here's what `GET /v1/clusters/{id}/statuses` returns with multiple adapters at different stages of the same generation. Like the [Status Response Structure](#status-response-structure) example, this is the paginated `AdapterStatusList` shape — not a single object with an embedded array.

**GET** `/v1/clusters/cls-550e8400/statuses`

```json
{
  "page": 1,
  "size": 3,
  "total": 3,
  "items": [
    {
      "adapter": "validation",
      "observed_generation": 1,
      "conditions": [
        {
          "type": "Available",
          "status": "True",
          "reason": "JobSucceeded",

      "last_report_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What This Shows**:

- **validation**: Completed successfully
- **dns**: Currently running
- **controlplane**: Waiting for preconditions (dns completion)
- Each item is an independent `AdapterStatus` object — there's no wrapping cluster-level object here, just the paginated list
- Easy to fetch and display complete cluster provisioning status by iterating `items` across all pages

## Complete Cluster Scenarios

This section demonstrates how cluster conditions evolve throughout the complete lifecycle, showing the interplay between adapter statuses and cluster-level condition aggregation.

### Scenario 1: Successful Cluster Provisioning

Timeline: cluster created at 12:00:00Z (generation 1) → validation starts at 12:00:05Z → validation succeeds at 12:02:00Z → dns starts at 12:03:00Z → dns succeeds at 12:05:00Z → controlplane starts at 12:05:30Z → controlplane succeeds at 12:10:00Z (cluster fully reconciled). The required adapters for this cluster are `validation`, `dns`, and `controlplane`.

#### Stage 1: Initial State

**Cluster State**: Just created, no adapters have reported yet. `Reconciled` and `LastKnownReconciled` are present from creation (see [ClusterStatus Fields](#clusterstatus-fields-aggregated-embedded-in-cluster-resource)), both `False`. No per-adapter `{AdapterName}Successful` conditions exist yet — those are only added once an adapter reports.

**GET** `/v1/clusters/cls-123`

    ]
  }
}
```

#### Stage 2: Validation Started

**Cluster State**: Validation adapter's first PUT (`Applied: True`, `Available: False`) adds `ValidationSuccessful` at `False`. `Reconciled` and `LastKnownReconciled` stay `False` — note `last_transition_time` does not move (the status value is still `False`), but `last_updated_time` does move, since a required adapter's report triggered recomputation.

  }
}
```

#### Stage 3: Validation Complete, DNS Started

**Cluster State**: `ValidationSuccessful` flips to `True` at 12:02:00Z (`last_transition_time` moves). `DnsSuccessful` appears at `False` (dns just started). `controlplane` hasn't reported at all yet, so it has no condition — this is how per-adapter conditions are added as adapters report.

#### Stage 4: All Adapters Complete

**Cluster State**: `controlplane` succeeds at 12:10:00Z, the last required adapter to report `Available: True`. `Reconciled` and `LastKnownReconciled` both flip to `True` at that moment.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note the timestamp behavior**: `last_transition_time` on `Reconciled`/`LastKnownReconciled` stayed pinned at `12:00:00Z` through Stages 1-3 even as the `message` text changed, because the *status value* never flipped — it only moved when the condition actually flipped to `True` in Stage 4. `last_updated_time`, by contrast, advanced at every stage because it's refreshed on every relevant adapter report, regardless of whether the status changed. See [Timestamp Fields Explained](#timestamp-fields-explained).

### Scenario 2: Cluster Provisioning with Failure

#### Stage 1: Validation Failure

**Cluster State**: Validation adapter failed due to a missing DNS zone (see [Adapter Failed (Business Logic)](#3-adapter-failed-business-logic)). `ValidationSuccessful` is `False`; `Reconciled` and `LastKnownReconciled` stay `False` since the cluster has never reconciled.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Stage 2: After Manual Fix — Retry at Generation 2

**Cluster State**: The user created the missing DNS zone and updated the cluster spec, bumping `generation` to 2. All required adapters re-reconcile and report `Available: True` at generation 2, so both `Reconciled` and `LastKnownReconciled` flip `True`.

      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Because this cluster was never successfully reconciled at generation 1, `LastKnownReconciled` was `False` right up until this point — it had no prior generation to stay "sticky" about. [Scenario 3](#scenario-3-health-issue-hidden-behind-a-reconciled-cluster) below shows the stickiness behavior on a cluster that already succeeded once.

### Scenario 3: Health Issue Hidden Behind a Reconciled Cluster

#### Stage 1: Cluster Fully Reconciled at Generation 1

**Cluster State**: All required adapters (`validation`, `dns`, `controlplane`) have reported `Available: True` at generation 1. This is the same fully-reconciled shape as [Scenario 1, Stage 4](#stage-4-all-adapters-complete), just with a different cluster ID.

**GET** `/v1/clusters/cls-789` returns `Reconciled: True`, `LastKnownReconciled: True`, and `True` for `ValidationSuccessful`, `DnsSuccessful`, and `ControlplaneSuccessful`.

#### Stage 2: `controlplane` Adapter Reports a Health Issue

**Cluster State**: The `controlplane` adapter PUTs again at generation 1 with `Available: True` (the provisioning work is still done) but `Health: False`, reporting an unexpected error.

`{AdapterName}Successful` mirrors only the adapter's `Available` condition (see [ClusterStatus Fields](#clusterstatus-fields-aggregated-embedded-in-cluster-resource)), never `Health`. So `ControlplaneSuccessful` stays `True` and `Reconciled`/`LastKnownReconciled` stay `True` — the Cluster-level `GET` response is unchanged and still looks fully healthy. The health problem is only visible via `GET /v1/clusters/cls-789/statuses`, in that adapter's `Health` condition. This is exactly [Query Pattern #3: Get Failed Adapters](#3-get-failed-adapters) — the aggregated conditions tell you whether work completed, not whether an adapter is currently healthy.

        }

      "last_report_time": "2025-10-17T12:20:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Stage 3: New Generation Started While the Health Issue Persists

**Cluster State**: The user updates the cluster spec, bumping `generation` to 2. The `validation` adapter starts reconciling generation 2, but `dns` and `controlplane` haven't reported at generation 2 yet. `Reconciled` flips back to `False` (not all required adapters are current at generation 2), but `LastKnownReconciled` **stays `True`** — because at generation 1, all required adapters *were* reconciled together. This is the clearest illustration in this guide of the "sticky cross-generation" behavior.

```json
"conditions": [
  {
    "type": "Reconciled",
    "status": "False",
    "reason": "ReconciledMissingAdapters",
    "message": "Required adapters not reporting Available=True: [controlplane, dns]. Currently reporting: [controlplane, dns, validation]",
    "observed_generation": 2,
    "created_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z",
    "last_transition_time": "2025-10-17T14:00:00Z",
    "last_updated_time": "2025-10-17T14:00:00Z"
  },
  {
    "type": "LastKnownReconciled",
    "status": "True",
    "reason": "AllAdaptersReconciled",
    "message": "All required adapters report Available=True for the tracked generation",
    "observed_generation": 1,
    "created_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z",
    "last_transition_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z",
    "last_updated_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z"
  }
]
```

Note that `Reconciled` recomputes because validation's new report at generation 2 is a "relevant adapter report": its `observed_generation` advances to `2`, and because its status just flipped True→False, `last_transition_time` moves too. `LastKnownReconciled`, by contrast, is **completely untouched** — same status, reason, message, observed_generation, and both timestamps as before generation 2 started. That's the sticky behavior in its purest form: since `dns`/`controlplane` are still reporting their (stale but) True generation-1 state, the aggregate is still "all-True-but-mixed-generation," and because it was already `True`, it stays `True` without being recomputed at all — not even its timestamps move.

### Condition Generation Examples

These examples show the real aggregated `ResourceCondition` types, reusing the exact values established in [Scenario 1, Stage 4](#stage-4-all-adapters-complete) rather than inventing new ones.

#### Reconciled Condition

Generated when all required adapters report `Available: True` at the current generation:

```json
{
  "type": "Reconciled",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "ReconciledAll",
  "message": "All required adapters reported Available=True or Finalized=True at the current generation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "created_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z",
  "last_transition_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z",
  "last_updated_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z"
}
```

#### LastKnownReconciled Condition

Generated the same way as `Reconciled`, but never flips back to `False` when a new generation starts mid-flight (see [Scenario 3, Stage 3](#stage-3-new-generation-started-while-the-health-issue-persists)):

```json
{
  "type": "LastKnownReconciled",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "AllAdaptersReconciled",
  "message": "All required adapters report Available=True for the tracked generation",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "created_time": "2025-10-17T12:00:00Z",
  "last_transition_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z",
  "last_updated_time": "2025-10-17T12:10:00Z"
}
```

#### {AdapterName}Successful Condition

Generated per required adapter, mirroring that adapter's own `Available` condition:

```json
{
  "type": "DnsSuccessful",
  "status": "True",
  "reason": "AllRecordsCreated",
  "message": "All DNS records created and verified",
  "observed_generation": 1,
  "created_time": "2025-10-17T12:03:00Z",
  "last_transition_time": "2025-10-17T12:05:00Z",
  "last_updated_time": "2025-10-17T12:05:00Z"
}
```

## Common Status Query Patterns

### 1. Wait for Specific Adapter

To poll until an adapter completes:

1. Fetch adapter statuses: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`
2. Find the adapter by `adapter` name in the `items` array
3. If not found, the adapter has not reported yet. Continue polling.
4. Verify `observed_generation === cluster.generation` (not stale)
5. Check `Available` condition:
   - `status: "True"` → adapter succeeded, stop polling
   - `status: "False"` → check `reason`:
     - `JobRunning` or `JobPending` → still in progress, continue polling
     - Other reasons → adapter failed, stop polling
6. Implement timeout (e.g., 10 minutes)

### 2. Check If Cluster is Reconciled

To verify cluster is fully provisioned:

1. Fetch cluster: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}`
2. Check the `Reconciled` condition in `status.conditions`:
   - `status: "True"` → all required adapters report `Available=True` at the current generation
3. For a stickier signal, check `LastKnownReconciled`:
   - `status: "True"` → all adapters were reconciled at a common generation (stays True even while a new generation is being processed)

### 3. Get Failed Adapters

To identify which adapters have failed:

1. Fetch cluster: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}`
2. Check per-adapter conditions in `status.conditions`:
   - `{AdapterName}Successful: "False"` → that adapter has a problem
3. Fetch detailed status for specifics: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`
4. For each failed adapter, find it by `adapter` name in `items`:
   - Get `Available` condition's `message` and `reason`
   - Get `Health` condition to determine if it's a health issue
5. Return list with failure details

### 4. Display Adapter Progress

To show progress UI:

1. Fetch adapter statuses: `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`
2. For each adapter in `items`:
   - Check conditions:
     - `Available: "True"` → Completed
     - `Available: "False"` with `JobRunning` reason → Running
     - `Available: "False"` with failure reason → Failed
     - `Health: "False"` → Unhealthy
     - `Applied: "False"` → Pending
3. Compare `observed_generation` to `cluster.generation` to detect stale adapters
4. Display adapter name, status icon, generation, and message from conditions

**Example Output**:

```text
validation - completed (gen 1)
   Job completed successfully after 115 seconds
dns - completed (gen 1)
   Created 5 DNS records
controlplane - running (gen 1)
   Kubernetes Job created successfully
nodepool - pending (gen 0)
   Not started
```

## Condition Reference

### Required Conditions (All Adapters)

| Type | True | False |
|------|------|-------|
| `Available` | Work completed successfully | Work failed, incomplete, or still in progress |
| `Applied` | Resources created successfully | Failed to create resources or not yet attempted |
| `Health` | No unexpected errors | Unexpected error occurred |

### Common Reason Values

**Available**:

- `JobSucceeded` - Job completed successfully
- `JobFailed` - Job failed
- `JobRunning` - Job still executing
- `ValidationPassed` - Validation checks passed
- `ValidationFailed` - Validation checks failed

**Applied**:

- `JobLaunched` - Job created successfully
- `ResourceCreationFailed` - Failed to create resource
- `ResourceQuotaExceeded` - Quota limit reached

**Health**:

- `NoErrors` - Adapter is healthy
- `AllChecksPassed` - All health checks passed
- `UnexpectedError` - Unexpected error occurred
- `ResourceNotFound` - Expected resource not found
- `APIConnectionFailed` - Failed to connect to API

## Best Practices

### DO

1. **Always include all three required conditions**

   ```json
   {
     "conditions": [
       {"type": "Available", "status": "True", /* ... */},
       {"type": "Applied", "status": "True", /* ... */},
       {"type": "Health", "status": "True", /* ... */}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Use positive condition types**
   - `DNSRecordsCreated` (status: True/False)
   - `DNSRecordsFailed` (confusing)

3. **Aggregate conditions to determine Available**
   - If any sub-condition is `False`, set `Available` to `False`
   - If all sub-conditions are `True`, set `Available` to `True`

4. **Provide actionable messages**

   ```json
   {
     "message": "Route53 zone not found for domain example.com. Create a public hosted zone before provisioning the cluster."
   }
   ```

5. **Use data field for structured information**

   ```json
   {
     "data": {
       "validationResults": { /* detailed results */ }
     }
   }
   ```

### DON'T

1. **Don't omit required conditions**

   ```json
   // BAD: Missing Health condition
   {
     "conditions": [
       {"type": "Available", /* ... */},
       {"type": "Applied", /* ... */}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Don't use negative condition names**

   ```json
   // BAD
   {"type": "ValidationFailed", "status": "True"}

   // GOOD
   {"type": "ValidationComplete", "status": "False"}
   ```

3. **Don't set Health: False for business logic failures**

   ```json
   // BAD: Validation failure is expected behavior
   {
     "type": "Health",
     "status": "False",
     "reason": "ValidationFailed"
   }

   // GOOD: Health is about adapter health, not business logic
   {
     "type": "Health",
     "status": "True",
     "reason": "NoErrors"
   }
   ```

## Summary

### Architecture Overview

**Adapter Statuses** (detailed, per-adapter):

- Adapters always PUT: `PUT /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses` with `adapter`, `observed_generation`, `observed_time`, and required conditions in payload
- API handles upsert internally: INSERT on first report, UPDATE on subsequent reports
- Each `AdapterStatus` contains conditions, data, and metadata for one adapter
- Retrieved as a paginated list via `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}/statuses`

**Cluster Object** (complete resource):

- Contains `id`, `name`, `generation`, `spec`, and lifecycle fields
- Contains `status` field with aggregated `ClusterStatus`:
  - `conditions`: Array of `ResourceCondition` entries computed by the API
  - Mandatory: `Reconciled` (all adapters at current generation), `LastKnownReconciled` (sticky cross-generation)
  - Per-adapter: `{AdapterName}Successful` (reflects that adapter's `Available` condition)
- Retrieved via `GET /v1/clusters/{clusterId}`

### Timestamp Fields Explained

Understanding when and how timestamps are set is critical for Sentinel's staleness detection:

| Field | Set By | Purpose | Calculation |
|-------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `AdapterStatus.created_time` | **API** | When this adapter status was first created | API-managed; value derived from the adapter-supplied `observed_time` on first PUT |
| `AdapterStatus.last_report_time` | **API** | When this adapter last reported | API-managed; updated on every PUT (even if conditions are unchanged); value derived from the adapter's `observed_time`, falling back to `time.Now()` only if `observed_time` is zero |
| `AdapterCondition.last_transition_time` | **API** | When this adapter's condition last flipped status | API-managed; adapters do not send this in PUT requests (see [AdapterStatus Fields](#adapterstatus-fields-returned-by-get-statuses)) |
| `ResourceCondition.last_transition_time` | **API** | When this aggregated condition (`Reconciled`, `LastKnownReconciled`, `{AdapterName}Successful`) last flipped status | API-managed; only updates when `status` actually changes, not on every recomputation |
| `ResourceCondition.last_updated_time` | **API** | When this aggregated condition was last recomputed | API-managed; copied from the `last_report_time` of the adapter whose PUT triggered the recomputation |
| PUT payload `observed_time` | **Adapter** | When the adapter observed the resource state it's reporting on | The one genuinely adapter-supplied timestamp; validated against a skew tolerance, then used to set both `created_time` and `last_report_time` |

There is no aggregated status timestamp inside `ClusterStatus` — it contains only `conditions` (see [ClusterStatus Fields](#clusterstatus-fields-aggregated-embedded-in-cluster-resource)); the parent `Cluster` resource still has its own `updated_time`. Sentinel does not evaluate individual adapters or their `AdapterStatus.last_report_time` at all — it never calls the `/statuses` endpoints. Instead, it evaluates one CEL-based decision per resource against the resource's own aggregated conditions.

#### How Sentinel Actually Detects Staleness

Sentinel's default decision config reads the resource's aggregated `Reconciled` condition via a `condition("Reconciled")` lookup and uses its `last_updated_time` as a reference point (`ref_time`). This feeds a small set of independent triggers, evaluated once per resource on every poll:

- **New resource**: `generation == 1` and not yet reconciled — always publish.
- **Generation mismatch**: `resource.generation > condition("Reconciled").observed_generation` — the spec changed since the last reconciliation attempt.
- **Reconciled but stale**: already `Reconciled: True`, but `now - ref_time` exceeds a safety-net threshold (30 minutes by default) — an eventual-consistency re-check, not a failure signal.
- **Not reconciled and debounced**: not yet `Reconciled: True`, and `now - ref_time` exceeds a short debounce window (10 seconds by default) — this is the trigger the [CRITICAL: Always Update `observed_time`](#critical-always-update-observed_time) rule protects against.

Because `Reconciled.last_updated_time` only advances when an adapter's PUT causes the API to recompute it (see the table above), an adapter that stops reporting — even though it has no work to do — can leave `Reconciled` stuck at `False` with a stale `last_updated_time`. Once the 10-second debounce window passes, Sentinel republishes a reconciliation event for the *whole resource* (not a specific adapter, since Sentinel has no concept of "which adapter" — every adapter subscribed to the resulting event re-evaluates its own preconditions independently).

### The Contract

1. **Three required conditions**: Available, Applied, Health (in each adapter PUT request). API returns `400` if any are missing.
2. **Paginated adapter statuses**: `GET /statuses` returns `AdapterStatusList` with individual `AdapterStatus` items
3. **Optional data field**: JSONB for structured information per adapter
4. **Additional conditions allowed**: All must be positive assertions (e.g., `Finalized` for deletion)
5. **Adapter aggregates**: All condition statuses determine Available
6. **Cluster aggregates**: All adapter `Available` conditions determine `Reconciled` and `{AdapterName}Successful`

### Condition Meanings

- **Available**: Did the work succeed? (True = complete, False = failed/incomplete/in-progress)
- **Applied**: Were resources created? (True = created, False = failed/not-attempted)
- **Health**: Any unexpected errors? (True = healthy, False = unexpected error)

### Key Principles

1. **Two-tier status model** - Aggregated `ClusterStatus` conditions on the Cluster resource for quick access, detailed `AdapterStatus` objects via `GET /statuses` for specifics
2. **Conditions are the contract** - Three required (Available, Applied, Health), plus optional `Finalized` for deletion
3. **Positive assertions** - All condition types should be positive
4. **Aggregation logic** - `Reconciled` reflects all adapters' `Available` at the current generation. `{AdapterName}Successful` mirrors each adapter's `Available`.
5. **Health vs Business Logic** - Health is about adapter errors, not validation failures
6. **Structured data** - Use `data` field for details beyond conditions
7. **API-managed timestamps** - `last_transition_time`, `created_time`, `last_report_time` are set by the API, not by adapters
