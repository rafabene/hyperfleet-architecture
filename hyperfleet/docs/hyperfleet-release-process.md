# HyperFleet Release Process

**Status**: Draft
**Owner**: HyperFleet Team
**Last Updated**: 2026-03-20

---

## Executive Summary

This documentation defines a comprehensive release process for HyperFleet (hyperfleet-api, hyperfleet-sentinel, and hyperfleet-adapter). The proposed process balances agility with stability, leveraging existing Prow infrastructure while establishing clear gates, workflows, and artifacts for production releases.

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Hybrid release cadence:** Regular releases (TBD by Tech Lead) for quality + ad-hoc releases for urgent requirements
  - Weeks 1-2 (TBD by Tech Lead): Active development
  - End of Week 2 (TBD by Tech Lead): Release Readiness Review (go/no-go)
  - Week 3 (TBD by Tech Lead, estimated 5 working days): Feature Freeze → Stabilization → Code Freeze → GA Release
- Git branching strategy with release branches and forward-port workflow (fix release first → forward-port to main)
- **Independent component versioning:** Each component (hyperfleet-api, hyperfleet-sentinel, hyperfleet-adapter) maintains its own semantic version
- Validated HyperFleet releases defined by compatibility-tested component version combinations
- Multi-gate release readiness criteria including automated and manual validation
- Structured bug triage workflow post-code freeze
- Comprehensive release artifacts including container images, Helm charts, and documentation
- **Start with Prow + manual release for MVP**, plan Konflux migration (with Enterprise Contract Policy support) for Post-MVP

---

## 1. Release Owner Checklist

This checklist guides the Release Owner through each phase of the release process. Use it to track progress, ensure all criteria are met, and communicate status to stakeholders.

### 1.1 Stakeholder Communication

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Development Team
- QE Owner
- CI Owner (Prow/Konflux)
- Tech Lead
- Manager

**Primary Communication Channels:**
- Slack: `#hyperfleet-releases` (create if not exists)
- Release ticket created by Tech Lead during sprint planning

---

### 1.2 Phase 1: Pre-Release Planning

**Timing:** End of Week 2, 1-2 days before Feature Freeze (TBD by Tech Lead)

This is your **Release Readiness Review** - assess whether you're ready to cut the release branch.

**Note on Release Owner Selection:**
The Release Owner for each release is identified before the release process begins. Initially, this role will be filled by the release document drafter. In the future, this will follow a rotation mechanism where team members take turns serving as Release Owner.

#### Setup
- [ ] Confirm Release Owner assignment in release ticket
- [ ] Identify target HyperFleet Release number (e.g., Release 1.5)
- [ ] Determine component versions and branching strategy (see [Versioning Strategy](#35-versioning-strategy))

#### Feature Completeness Assessment
- [ ] Review all planned features for milestone - which are code-complete? (see [Feature Completeness Gate](#21-feature-completeness-gate))
- [ ] Identify features that won't make this release (defer to next)
- [ ] Feature toggles in place for incomplete features if applicable
- [ ] Feature documentation drafted for completed features
- [ ] No CRITICAL/HIGH security vulnerabilities unaddressed (once konflux job is supported)
- [ ] Technical debt reviewed and acceptable items explicitly deferred to next release
- [ ] All deprecated APIs have migration paths documented

#### Documentation Readiness
- [ ] Release notes draft exists with completed features
- [ ] Known issues documented
- [ ] Component documentation up-to-date:
  - [ ] hyperfleet-api documentation
  - [ ] hyperfleet-sentinel documentation
  - [ ] hyperfleet-adapter documentation
- [ ] Compatibility matrix documented showing which component versions work together
- [ ] Breaking changes (if any) documented with migration guides and version requirements

#### CI/CD and Build Health
- [ ] Prow CI pipeline is green for all components on the main branch
- [ ] Container images build successfully for all target architectures
- [ ] Helm charts package without errors

#### Stakeholder Communication
- [ ] **Slack**: Announce release readiness status to `#hyperfleet-releases`
  ```
  📅 HyperFleet Release X.Y - Readiness Review
  - Feature Freeze: [DATE] (Week 3, Day 1)
  - Target GA: [DATE] (Week 3, Day 5)
  - Release Owner: @your-name
  - Status: [Ready/At Risk - explain]
  ```
- [ ] **Tech Lead**: Confirm feature scope
- [ ] **CI Owner**: Verify Prow jobs are stable on main branch
- [ ] **QE Owner**: Confirm testing capacity for Week 3

#### Go/No-Go Decision
- [ ] **If READY**: Proceed to Feature Freeze on Week 3, Day 1
- [ ] **If AT RISK**:
  - [ ] Identify specific blockers and estimated resolution time
  - [ ] Raise risk to **Manager** and **Tech Lead** for approval
  - [ ] Options: Defer release by X days, or descope features and proceed

**Exit Criteria:** All features complete, documentation drafted, CI green, stakeholder alignment → Proceed to Feature Freeze

---

### 1.3 Phase 2: Feature Freeze

**Timing:** Start of Week 3 in sprint (TBD by Tech Lead)

#### Branch Creation
Create branches for components and supporting repositories (see [Branching Model](#31-branching-model)):

```bash
# Example: hyperfleet-api getting v1.5.0
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b release-1.5
git push origin release-1.5
```

For components (using component-specific semantic version):
- [ ] **hyperfleet-api**: Create `release-X.Y` branch (if version bump)
- [ ] **hyperfleet-sentinel**: Create `release-X.Y` branch (if version bump)
- [ ] **hyperfleet-adapter**: Create `release-X.Y` branch (if version bump)

For supporting repos (using HyperFleet release version, e.g., `release-1.5`):
- [ ] **hyperfleet-e2e**: Create `release-X.Y` branch
- [ ] **hyperfleet-infra**: Create `release-X.Y` branch and update charts, images to correct component versions
- [ ] **hyperfleet-release**: Create `release-X.Y` branch

#### Configure Prow Jobs (see [Prow Job Configuration](#40-prow-job-configuration-for-release-branches))
**Note:** Must be done BEFORE tagging RC1, as RC1 builds depend on these jobs.

- [ ] **CI Owner**: Copy build jobs for release branches
- [ ] **CI Owner**: Copy nightly E2E jobs for release branch testing
- [ ] Verify release branch Prow jobs are configured correctly

#### Cut First Release Candidate
For each component, tag RC1 (see [Code Freeze Mechanics](#33-code-freeze-mechanics)):

```bash
# Example: hyperfleet-api v1.5.0-rc.1
git checkout release-1.5
git tag -a v1.5.0-rc.1 -m "hyperfleet-api RC1 for v1.5.0"
git push origin v1.5.0-rc.1
```

- [ ] Tag RC1 for each component: `vX.Y.0-rc.1`
- [ ] **Verify Prow builds container images for all RC1 tags** (wait for builds to complete)
- [ ] Confirm all RC1 images pushed to `quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-*`

#### Stakeholder Communication
- [ ] **Slack**: Announce Feature Freeze
  ```
  🔒 Feature Freeze - HyperFleet Release X.Y
  - Release branches created
  - RC1 tagged: [component versions]
  - Main branch OPEN for X.Y+1 development
  - Bug fixes: Fix in release branch first, then forward-port to main
  ```
- [ ] **Developers**: Notify team that `main` branch reopens for X.Y+1 development
- [ ] **QE Owner**: Notify RC1 ready for testing, share component versions

**Exit Criteria:** Release branches created, RC1 tagged, Prow jobs configured → Begin Stabilization

---

### 1.4 Phase 3: Stabilization & Testing

**Timing:** Days 1-3 of Week 3 (TBD by Tech Lead)

#### Testing Execution (see [Testing & Validation](#41-testing--validation-mandatory))
- [ ] **QE Owner**: E2E test suite execution started
- [ ] **QE Owner**: Cross-component compatibility validation
- [ ] **QE Owner**: Backward compatibility testing (N-1 version)
- [ ] **QE Owner**: Performance benchmarks (no regression > 10%) (once performance testing is supported)

#### Bug Triage (see [Bug Triage Process](#51-bug-triage-process))
Monitor bugs reported during stabilization:

- [ ] Review all new bugs daily with severity assignment
- [ ] **Blocker/Critical bugs**: Assign developer immediately (see [Decision Framework](#52-decision-framework))
  - [ ] Developer fixes in release branch first (link bug ticket in PR)
  - [ ] Forward-port to main (same bug ticket, stays open until both merged)
  - [ ] Both developer AND Release Owner verify forward-port completion
  - [ ] Cut new RC if needed (e.g., `vX.Y.0-rc.2`)
  - [ ] Re-run full E2E test suite to validate RC and detect regressions
- [ ] **Major bugs**: Evaluate fix or defer decision (see [Decision Framework](#52-decision-framework))
- [ ] **Normal/Minor bugs**: Defer to next release

#### Bug Fix Process (see [Bug Fix Workflow](#33-code-freeze-mechanics))
For each bug fix needed in release:

```bash
# 1. Fix in release branch first
git checkout release-X.Y
# Create PR to release-X.Y (link bug ticket) → Release Owner approves

# 2. Forward-port to main (manual or cherry-pick)
git checkout main
# Apply fix manually OR cherry-pick if clean
# Create PR to main (link SAME bug ticket)

# 3. Verification by BOTH developer and Release Owner
# Bug ticket stays open until BOTH PRs merged
```

- [ ] All release PRs have Release Owner approval
- [ ] All release PRs include justification and risk assessment
- [ ] All bug tickets linked in both release and main PRs
- [ ] Maintain forward-port tracking list (check daily for pending forward-ports)
- [ ] Verify forward-port completion before closing bug tickets

#### Stakeholder Communication
- [ ] **Daily**: Update release ticket with bug triage status
- [ ] **Daily Slack Update** (`#hyperfleet-releases`): Post daily status update
  ```
  📊 Daily Status - HyperFleet Release X.Y (Day N of Stabilization)
  - Testing Progress: [E2E: 80% complete, Integration: PASSING]
  - Bugs Found: [X Blocker, Y Critical, Z Major]
  - Risks: [Any delays, blockers, or concerns]
  - ETA: [On track / At risk - explain]
  ```
- [ ] **When new RC cut**: Notify QE Owner that RC is ready for testing, share updated component versions
- [ ] **Tech Lead**: Review major bugs and defer/fix decisions

**Exit Criteria:** E2E tests passing, no Blocker/Critical/Major bugs → Enter Code Freeze

---

---

### 1.6 Phase 5: GA Release

**Timing:** End of Day 5, Week 3 (TBD by Tech Lead)

#### Tag GA Release
For each component, tag final version (see [Practical Example](#352-practical-example-hyperfleet-release-15)):

```bash
# Example: hyperfleet-api v1.5.0 GA
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api
git checkout release-1.5
git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "hyperfleet-api v1.5.0 - GitOps integration"
git push origin v1.5.0
```

  - Container Images: quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-*
  ```
- [ ] **Developers**: Notify release is complete
- [ ] **Offering Team**: Notify for GCP integration deployment
- [ ] **Pillar Teams**: Share release notes and upgrade instructions

**Exit Criteria:** All artifacts published, stakeholders notified → Enter Post-Release

---

### 1.7 Phase 6: Post-Release

**Timing:** Immediately after GA

#### Immediate Actions (Day 1)
- [ ] Monitor nightly Prow jobs on release branch
- [ ] Monitor for critical bugs reported
- [ ] Update release ticket status to "Completed"

#### Retrospective (Within 1 week) if required
- [ ] Schedule retrospective with team (see [Conduct Retrospectives and Identify Improvements](#921-conduct-retrospectives-and-identify-improvements))
- [ ] Collect metrics:
  - [ ] Code freeze duration
  - [ ] Number of RCs cut
  - [ ] Bugs found post-Feature Freeze
  - [ ] On-time delivery (yes/no)
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update release process if needed

#### Patch Release Monitoring (see [Release Branch Maintenance](#34-release-branch-maintenance))
- [ ] Monitor nightly Prow E2E jobs on `release-X.Y` branch (runs until EOL at 6 months)
- [ ] Investigate and address any nightly test failures to detect regressions early
- [ ] Track bugs for potential patch releases
- [ ] Blocker/Critical bugs → Hotfix within 48 hours (see [Hotfix Workflow](#54-hotfix-workflow-post-ga))
- [ ] Major bugs → Patch release within 1 week
- [ ] Disable nightly jobs when release reaches EOL

#### Stakeholder Communication if required
- [ ] **Slack**: Share retrospective findings
- [ ] **Tech Lead**: Discuss process improvements

---

### 1.8 Ad-Hoc Release Process

When urgent release needed outside regular cadence:

#### Request Evaluation
- [ ] Create ad-hoc release request using template (Appendix C)
- [ ] Evaluate justification: Why can't this wait?
- [ ] Assess risk level and blast radius
- [ ] Determine if Full HyperFleet Release or Single Component Patch

#### Approval
- [ ] Get Tech Lead approval
- [ ] Get Manager approval
- [ ] Document approval and conditions in request issue

#### Execution (3-5 days timeline)
- [ ] Follow condensed testing plan (unit, integration, E2E for affected components)
- [ ] Cut RC and validate
- [ ] Tag GA release
- [ ] Notify stakeholders 48 hours in advance minimum
- [ ] Monitor post-release for 24 hours

---

### 1.9 Emergency Hotfix Process (Post-GA)

For critical bugs discovered after GA:

#### Severity Assessment
- [ ] Confirm severity: Blocker or Critical only
- [ ] Identify affected component(s)
- [ ] Estimate impact and timeline

#### Hotfix Execution (see [Hotfix Workflow](#54-hotfix-workflow-post-ga))
```bash
# Create hotfix branch from GA tag (previous patch version)
git checkout -b hotfix-X.Y.Z vX.Y.(Z-1)
# Apply fix, test, commit
git commit -m "Fix critical bug"
# Merge to release branch
git checkout release-X.Y
git merge --no-ff hotfix-X.Y.Z
# Tag patch release
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Patch release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin release-X.Y --tags
```

- [ ] Fix in release branch first (link bug ticket in PR)
- [ ] Forward-port to main if applicable (same bug ticket, stays open until both merged)
- [ ] Both developer AND Release Owner verify forward-port completion
- [ ] Tag next patch version: `vX.Y.Z` (NO RC for patches, see [Branching Model](#31-branching-model))
- [ ] Run focused test suite
- [ ] Deploy hotfix

#### Timeline
- [ ] **Blocker/Critical**: Patch within 48 hours
- [ ] **Major**: Not part of Emergency Hotfix; route to standard patch release workflow

#### Stakeholder Communication
- [ ] **Slack**: Immediate notification of critical issue
  ```
  🚨 Critical Hotfix - Component vX.Y.Z
  - Issue: [description]
  - Severity: Critical
  - ETA: [timeline]
  - Tracking: [LINK]
  ```
- [ ] **Slack**: Notify when hotfix released
- [ ] **Offering Team**: Coordinate deployment

## 2. Release Entry Criteria

These criteria determine when the development team can initiate the release process and enter code freeze.

### 2.1 Feature Completeness Gate

**Decision Point:** Can we enter Feature Freeze and create release branches?

**Gate Criteria:**
- ✓ All planned features code-complete OR explicitly deferred with justification
- ✓ No CRITICAL/HIGH security vulnerabilities unaddressed
- ✓ Feature documentation exists for completed features
- ✓ Technical debt reviewed and deferred items documented
- ✓ Deprecated APIs have migration paths

**If criteria not met:**
- **Option 1:** Defer release to allow feature completion (requires Tech Lead approval)
- **Option 2:** Descope incomplete features and proceed on schedule
- **Option 3:** Accept risk with documented justification (Manager approval required)

**Detailed execution checklist:** See [Pre-Release Planning - Feature Completeness Assessment](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning)

### 2.2 Testing & Quality Gate

**Decision Point:** Is the codebase stable enough to proceed with Feature Freeze?

**Gate Criteria:**
- ✓ CI/CD pipeline green on main branch (unit, integration, E2E tests passing)
- ✓ Container images build successfully for all target architectures
- ✓ Helm charts package without errors
- ✓ No performance regression >10% vs. previous release (once performance testing is supported)

**If criteria not met:**
- **Blocker:** Fix failing tests before Feature Freeze (CI must be green)
- **Build failures:** Resolve build issues immediately (blocks release branch creation)
- **Performance regression:** Evaluate impact - fix or defer with Tech Lead approval

**Quality Standards:**
- Unit test coverage ensured by pre-submit jobs (not part of release gating)
- Integration and E2E tests validate critical user journeys
- Performance benchmarks track regression trends

**Detailed execution checklist:** See [Pre-Release Planning - CI/CD and Build Health](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning) and [Stabilization & Testing](#14-phase-3-stabilization--testing)

### 2.3 Cross-Component Compatibility Gate

**Decision Point:** Are component versions determined and integration validated?

**Gate Criteria:**
- ✓ Component versions determined using independent semantic versioning
- ✓ Cross-component API contracts validated during integration testing
- ✓ Component version combinations pass integration tests

**Versioning Model:**
- Each component (hyperfleet-api, hyperfleet-sentinel, hyperfleet-adapter) maintains its own semantic version
- HyperFleet Release X.Y defines a validated, compatibility-tested set of component versions
- See [Versioning Strategy](#35-versioning-strategy) for detailed approach

**If criteria not met:**
- **Compatibility untested:** Execute integration test suite before proceeding to Feature Freeze
- **API contract violations:** Fix compatibility issues or update API contracts with proper versioning

**Note:** Full backward compatibility (N-1 upgrade) testing happens during Stabilization phase (see [Stabilization & Testing](#14-phase-3-stabilization--testing))

**Detailed execution checklist:** See [Pre-Release Planning - CI/CD and Build Health](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning)

### 2.4 Documentation Readiness Gate

**Decision Point:** Is documentation ready to support the release?

**Gate Criteria:**
- ✓ Release notes draft exists with major features listed
- ✓ Known issues and limitations documented
- ✓ Compatibility matrix documented showing which component versions work together
- ✓ Breaking changes (if any) documented with migration guides and version requirements
- ✓ Upgrade/migration documentation drafted (if applicable)
- ✓ Component documentation up-to-date (hyperfleet-api, hyperfleet-sentinel, hyperfleet-adapter)

**If criteria not met:**
- **Release notes missing:** Documentation can be finalized during Code Freeze, but draft must exist
- **Breaking changes undocumented:** Block release until migration guides completed
- **Component docs outdated:** Update during stabilization phase
- **Upgrade guide missing:** Block GA release until completed (mandatory for releases with breaking changes)

**Documentation refinement:**
- Draft documentation acceptable at Feature Freeze
- Final polish and validation during Code Freeze phase
- See [Documentation Completeness](#43-documentation-completeness-mandatory) for final GA requirements

**Detailed execution checklist:** See [Pre-Release Planning - Documentation Readiness](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning) and [Code Freeze - Documentation Finalization](#15-phase-4-code-freeze) 

### 2.5 Organizational Readiness Gate

**Decision Point:** Are people and processes ready to execute the release?

**Gate Criteria:**
- ✓ Release Owner identified and assigned
- ✓ Stakeholder communication plan is in place

**If criteria not met:**
- **No Release Owner:** Assign Release Owner before proceeding (mandatory role)
- **Communication plan missing:** Define communication channels and stakeholder notification plan

**Detailed execution checklist:** See [Pre-Release Planning - Setup](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning) and [Stakeholder Communication](#12-phase-1-pre-release-planning)

---

**Final Decision Point:** When all gates above (2.1-2.5) are met, the Release Owner can call for Feature Freeze and transition to code stabilization phase.

---

## 3. Code Freeze and Branching Strategy

### 3.1 Branching Model

HyperFleet follows a **release branch workflow** based on Kubernetes and OpenShift best practices:

```text
main (development branch)
  │
  │ Active Development Phase
  │
  ├─── release-X.Y (branch created at Feature Freeze)
  │      │
  │      │ Stabilization Phase (bug fixes only)
  │      │
  │      │ Code Freeze (critical fixes only)
  │      │
  │      ├─── vX.Y.0-rc.1 (tag - Release Candidate 1)
  │      ├─── vX.Y.0-rc.2 (tag - Release Candidate 2, if needed)
  │      └─── vX.Y.0 (tag - GA Release)
  │
  │ (main branch continues with X.Y+1 development)
  │
  └─── (next release cycle)

After GA:
release-X.Y (branch maintained post-release)
  │
  ├─── vX.Y.1 (tag - Z-stream/patch release, NO RC)
  ├─── vX.Y.2 (tag - Z-stream/patch release, NO RC)
  └─── ... (support window: 6 months)
```

**Note on Z-Stream (Patch) Releases:**
- Z-stream releases (vX.Y.1, vX.Y.2, etc.) **do not require Release Candidate (RC) tags**
- These releases go directly from testing to GA tag
- Scope limited to bug fixes, security patches, and minor improvements (no new features or breaking changes)
- Faster turnaround for low-risk fixes while maintaining quality gates

### 3.2 Timeline and Freeze Process

**Release Cycle:** TBD by Tech Lead after initial releases

**Timeline Breakdown:**
- **Weeks 1-2 (TBD by Tech Lead - Development Phase):** Active feature development, normal PR process on `main` branch
  - Continuous testing on all PRs (unit, integration, linting)
  - Documentation written alongside code
  - Features merged as they're completed
  - **End of Week 2 (TBD by Tech Lead):** Release Readiness Review (go/no-go decision)
- **Week 3 (TBD by Tech Lead, estimated 5 working days - Stabilization & Release Phase):**
  - **Day 1:** Feature Freeze - create `release-X.Y` branch, cut RC.1
    - `main` branch reopens immediately for next release development
  - **Days 1-3:** Stabilization - bug fixes applied to release branch first, then forward-ported to main, full E2E test suite execution (automated + manual)
  - **Days 4-5:** Code Freeze - only critical/blocker fixes with Release Owner approval, documentation finalization, final validation and sign-off
  - **End of Day 5:** GA release tagged and published with all artifacts

**Note:** Timeline can be adjusted based on actual circumstances. As the product matures and automation capabilities improve, the team should continuously refine and optimize the release cadence based on actual data and lessons learned from each release cycle.

### 3.3 Code Freeze Mechanics

**Feature Freeze:**
```bash
# Release Owner creates release branch from main (per component repo)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release-1.5
git push origin release-1.5

# Create first release candidate (per component version)
git tag -a v1.5.0-rc.1 -m "hyperfleet-api RC1 for v1.5.0"
git push origin v1.5.0-rc.1
```

**After Feature Freeze:**
- `main` branch reopens immediately for next release (v1.6) development
- All changes to `release-1.5` branch follow the fix workflow below
- Release Owner reviews and approves all PRs to release branch

**Code Freeze:**
- Only Critical or above bug fixes allowed into release branch (Blocker, Critical)
- Each fix requires:
  - Bug severity: Critical or above (Blocker, Critical)
  - Release Owner approval
  - Successful test run in Prow
  - Risk assessment documented

**Bug Fix Workflow:**

**All fixes follow the same order: Release branch first → Main branch second**

```
Bug found in release branch
    │
    ├─ Does the bug also exist in main?
    │   │
    │   YES → Choose forward-port method below
    │   │
    │   NO → Release-specific fix
    │        1. Create PR directly to release-X.Y branch
    │        2. Document in PR why bug doesn't exist in main
    │        3. Release Owner approves with justification review
    │        4. Bug ticket can be closed after release PR merges
```

**Primary Method - Manual Forward-Port (Default):**

Use this when main has diverged or fix is complex:

```bash
# 1. Fix in release branch first
git checkout release-X.Y
# Create PR to release-X.Y, link bug ticket, merge after Release Owner approval

# 2. Forward-port to main manually
git checkout main
# Manually apply the fix (rewrite if needed due to divergence)
# Create PR to main, link SAME bug ticket

# 3. Verification (MANDATORY):
# - Original developer: Confirms forward-port PR merged to main
# - Release Owner: Verifies forward-port completion
# - Bug ticket CANNOT be closed until BOTH release AND main are fixed
```

**Alternative Method - Cherry-Pick Forward-Port (When Clean):**

Use only when cherry-pick is clean and low-risk:
- Fix is small (< 50 lines, single file)
- Main and release haven't diverged in that code area
- You verified cherry-pick succeeds cleanly with no conflicts

```bash
# 1. Fix in release branch first
git checkout release-X.Y
# Create PR to release-X.Y, link bug ticket, merge after Release Owner approval

# 2. Cherry-pick forward-port to main
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-sha-from-release>

# 3. If conflicts occur → STOP, use manual forward-port instead
# 4. If clean → Create PR to main for review, link SAME bug ticket

# 5. Same verification requirements as primary method
```

### 3.4 Release Branch Maintenance

**Support Policy:** 6 months with lifecycle stages

Every release receives 6 months of support from its GA date, divided into two phases:

#### Phase 1: Full Support (first 3 months)
- All bug fixes and enhancements
- Patch releases for any severity (Major+)
- Active maintenance

#### Phase 2: Security Maintenance (months 3-6)
- CRITICAL and HIGH security vulnerabilities only
- Blocker bugs affecting production stability
- Limited patch releases

#### After 6 months: End of Life (EOL)
- No further updates
- Users must upgrade to supported version

#### Backport Decision Tree:
- Version < 3 months old: Backport all Major+ severity bugs
- Version 3-6 months old: Backport only CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs and Blockers
- Version > 6 months old: EOL, no backports

### 3.5 Versioning Strategy

**HyperFleet uses independent component versioning** with validated release combinations.

Each core component (hyperfleet-api, hyperfleet-sentinel, hyperfleet-adapter) maintains its own semantic version number, evolving at its own pace based on changes and feature development.

```text
HyperFleet Release 1.5 (validated combination):
├─ hyperfleet-api: v1.5.0
├─ hyperfleet-sentinel: v1.4.2
└─ hyperfleet-adapter: v2.0.0
```

**Rationale:**
- **Flexibility:** Components can evolve independently without forcing artificial version bumps
- **Semantic accuracy:** Version numbers reflect actual changes (v1.4.2 → v1.4.3 for bug fix, not v1.4.2 → v1.5.0)
- **Efficient releases:** Components without changes don't require new versions or rebuilds
- **Clear change tracking:** Each component's version history accurately reflects its evolution
- **Industry standard:** Aligns with microservices best practices (Kubernetes components, cloud services)

**HyperFleet Release Number:**
- Defines a validated, compatibility-tested set of component versions
- Format: "HyperFleet Release X.Y" (e.g., Release 1.5, Release 1.6)
- Documented in release notes with full compatibility matrix
- Simplifies user experience: "Install HyperFleet Release 1.5" with clear component version mapping

#### 3.5.1 Branching and Tagging Rules

**Key Principles:**
1. **Independent branching:** Each component creates release branches based on its own version (e.g., `release-1.5`, `release-2.0`)
2. **Independent tagging:** Each component tags releases according to its semantic version (e.g., `v1.5.0`, `v1.4.2`, `v2.0.0`)
3. **Selective releases:** Only components with changes create new release branches and tags

**Why?** Components evolve at their own pace, and version numbers should accurately reflect actual changes.

**Component-Specific Releases:**

Between HyperFleet releases, individual components can issue releases independently:

```bash
# Example: Critical bug found in hyperfleet-sentinel after HyperFleet Release 1.5 GA
# Current: HyperFleet Release 1.5 (API v1.5.0, hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.2, Adapter v2.0.0)

# hyperfleet-sentinel creates patch release v1.4.3
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-sentinel
git checkout release-1.4
# Apply fix, test
git tag -a v1.4.3 -m "hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.3 - Hotfix for metrics bug"
git push origin v1.4.3

# Result: Users can upgrade just hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.2 → v1.4.3 without full release
# No new HyperFleet Release number needed for single-component release
```

**When to Create Component Release vs HyperFleet Release:**

**Component Release:**

Create a component release only for isolated, fully backward-compatible fixes within a single component that do not impact APIs, schemas, cross-component behavior, or coordinated platform upgrades.

**HyperFleet Release:**

Create a HyperFleet release whenever a change affects supported platform users, introduces cross-component compatibility or contract implications, delivers security or critical stability fixes, or requires coordinated, platform-wide, validated upgrades.

**Supporting Repository Branching for HyperFleet Releases:**

When creating a HyperFleet release, the following supporting repositories also participate in the release process:

**For Major/Minor Releases (e.g., HyperFleet Release 1.5):**

1. **hyperfleet-e2e** - E2E test suites
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze
   - Contains E2E tests validating the specific component combinations for this release

2. **hyperfleet-infra** - Infrastructure configurations
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze (if infrastructure changes needed)
   - Contains deployment scripts, cluster configs aligned with this release

3. **hyperfleet-release** - Release coordination and documentation
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze
   - Contains release notes, compatibility matrices, installation guides
   - Tag the release: `release-1.5` at GA

**For Patch Releases (e.g., HyperFleet Release 1.5.1, 1.5.2):**

Supporting repositories **do not create new branches** for patch releases:

1. **hyperfleet-e2e, hyperfleet-infra**
   - Stay on existing `release-1.5` branch
   - Commit updates/fixes to the same branch as needed

2. **hyperfleet-release**
   - Stay on existing `release-1.5` branch
   - Update release notes and compatibility matrix
   - **Create new tag** for each patch: `release-1.5.1`, `release-1.5.2`

   ```bash
   # Example: HyperFleet Release 1.5.1 (patch)
   cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-release
   git checkout release-1.5

   # Update release notes with patch changes
   # (e.g., hyperfleet-api v1.5.0 → v1.5.1)

   # Tag the patch release
   git tag -a release-1.5.1 -m "HyperFleet Release 1.5.1 (API v1.5.1, hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.2, Adapter v2.0.0)"
   git push origin release-1.5.1
   ```

**Rationale:** Patch releases are incremental updates on the same base release. Supporting repos use the same branch infrastructure with updated content and new tags to mark each patch version.

#### 3.5.2 Practical Example: HyperFleet Release 1.5

**Scenario:**
- hyperfleet-api: **Major feature** (new GitOps integration) → Version bump to v1.5.0
- hyperfleet-sentinel: **Bug fixes only** → Patch version bump to v1.4.2
- hyperfleet-adapter: **Breaking changes** → Major version bump to v2.0.0

**At Feature Freeze - Create Component-Specific Release Branches:**

```bash
# hyperfleet-api - MINOR version bump (new features)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api
git checkout -b release-1.5 && git push origin release-1.5

# hyperfleet-sentinel - PATCH version bump (bug fixes only)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-sentinel
git checkout -b release-1.4 && git push origin release-1.4
# (or use existing release-1.4 branch if it already exists)

# hyperfleet-adapter - MAJOR version bump (breaking changes)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-adapter
git checkout -b release-2.0 && git push origin release-2.0
```

**At GA Release - Tag Each Component with Its Own Version:**

```bash
# hyperfleet-api - Tag v1.5.0 (new minor version)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api
git checkout release-1.5
git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "hyperfleet-api v1.5.0 - GitOps integration"
git push origin v1.5.0

# hyperfleet-sentinel - Tag v1.4.2 (patch release)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-sentinel
git checkout release-1.4
git tag -a v1.4.2 -m "hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.2 - Memory leak fix"
git push origin v1.4.2

# hyperfleet-adapter - Tag v2.0.0 (major version)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-adapter
git checkout release-2.0
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "hyperfleet-adapter v2.0.0 - Plugin API v2"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

**Result:**
```text
HyperFleet Release 1.5 (validated combination):

Component Release Branches:
- hyperfleet-api: release-1.5
- hyperfleet-sentinel: release-1.4
- hyperfleet-adapter: release-2.0

Component Version Tags:
- hyperfleet-api: v1.5.0
- hyperfleet-sentinel: v1.4.2
- hyperfleet-adapter: v2.0.0

Container Images (for HyperFleet Release 1.5):
- quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api:v1.5.0
- quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-sentinel:v1.4.2
- quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-adapter:v2.0.0

Compatibility:
- hyperfleet-api v1.5.0 requires hyperfleet-adapter ≥ v2.0.0
- hyperfleet-sentinel v1.4.2 is compatible with hyperfleet-adapter v1.x and v2.x
- Full compatibility matrix documented in release notes
```

## 4. Release Readiness Criteria

Before declaring a release as "GA-Ready", all the following criteria must be satisfied:

### 4.0 Prow Job Configuration for Release Branches

After creating release branches for components and supporting repositories, Prow jobs must be configured to support release branch builds and testing.

**Required Prow Job Configuration:**

**1. Copy Build Jobs for Release Images**

After cutting component release branches (e.g., `release-1.5` for hyperfleet-api, `release-1.4` for hyperfleet-sentinel):

- **Action:** Copy existing Prow jobs that build container images from `main` branch
- **Update:** Configure copied jobs to trigger on release branch commits
- **Purpose:** Enable automated image builds from release branches when fixes are merged
- **Result:** Release images automatically built and pushed to registry when release branch is updated

**2. Copy E2E Prow Jobs for Nightly Release Testing**

After cutting `hyperfleet-e2e` release branch (e.g., `release-1.5`):

- **Action:** Copy E2E test Prow jobs that run nightly on `main` branch
- **Update:** Configure copied jobs to:
  - Run against the release branch E2E test suite
  - Test the validated component version combination for this release
  - Trigger nightly to detect regressions in release branch
- **Purpose:** Continuous validation of release stability throughout support lifecycle
- **Result:** Early detection of issues in release branches before they reach users

**Best Practices:**
- Copy jobs at Feature Freeze when release branches are created
- Maintain consistent naming convention: `{job-name}-release-X.Y`
- Monitor nightly release test results for regressions
- Disable nightly jobs when release reaches EOL (after 6 months)

### 4.1 Testing & Validation (Mandatory)

**Unit & Integration Testing:**
- ✓ All unit tests passing across all components
- ✓ Integration test suite passing

**E2E Testing:**
- ✓ Critical user workflows validated (E2E test suite)
- ✓ Backward compatibility testing with N-1 version
- ✓ Installation/upgrade path tested

**Performance & Load Testing (once performance testing is supported):**
- ✓ Performance benchmarks show no regression > 10% vs. previous release
- ✓ Load testing validates system handles expected production load
- ✓ Resource utilization (CPU, memory) within acceptable bounds

**Note:** Automated testing is preferred for all scenarios. If a test scenario is not yet automated, it must be executed manually before release approval.

### 4.2 Bug Severity Gates (Mandatory)

- ✓ No open bugs with severity **Major** or above (Blocker, Critical, Major)
- ✓ `Normal` bugs are tracked for follow-up and do not block GA unless explicitly elevated by Release Owner + Tech Lead
- ✓ Minor bugs:  No gate, tracked for future releases

### 4.3 Documentation Completeness (Mandatory)

**Release Documentation:**
- ✓ Release notes finalized (what's new, bug fixes, breaking changes)
- ✓ Known issues and limitations documented
- ✓ Deprecation notices published (if applicable)

**Operational Documentation:**
- ✓ Installation guide updated
- ✓ Upgrade instructions complete (N-1 → N)
- ✓ Deployment runbook created and reviewed

**Technical Documentation:**
- ✓ Component documentation updated (if changed):
  - hyperfleet-api documentation 
  - hyperfleet-sentinel documentation 
  - hyperfleet-adapter documentation 
- ✓ Configuration changes documented per component

### 4.4 Cross-Team Coordination

- ⚠ Integration validation with dependent offerings (TBD)

### 4.5 Security & Compliance

**Mandatory (All Phases):**
- ✓ Vulnerability scanning: No CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs in container images

**Post-MVP (Deferred to Konflux Migration):**
- ⚠ Supply chain security: SLSA Level 3 provenance generated
- ⚠ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated
- ⚠ Container images signed with Sigstore/Cosign
- ⚠ Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement

**Note:** For MVP, focus on vulnerability scanning. Full supply chain security (SBOM, signing, provenance) will be implemented during Post-MVP Konflux migration.

### 4.6 Release Artifacts Verification (Mandatory)

- ✓ All container images built and pushed to registry
- ✓ Helm charts packaged and tested
- ✓ Git tags created with correct version
- ✓ Release artifacts checksums/signatures verified

**Gate Decision:** Only when ALL mandatory criteria are met can the release be declared GA-ready and published.

## 5. Bug Handling Workflow After Code Freeze

### 5.1 Bug Triage Process

When a bug is discovered after code freeze (during RC testing or late in release cycle):

```text
            Bug Reported
                 │
                 ↓
      ┌─────────────────────────┐
      │ Initial Assessment      │
      │ - Severity assignment   │
      │ - Reproducibility       │
      │ - Impact analysis       │
      └───────────┬─────────────┘
                  │
                  ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Severity-Based Routing            │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┤
│ Blocker/     │    Major     │ Normal/Minor │
│ Critical     │              │              │
└──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┘
       │              │              │
       ↓              ↓              ↓
  [FIX NOW]    [TRIAGE MEETING]  [DEFER]
```

### 5.2 Decision Framework

**For Blocker/Critical bugs:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Developer assigned within 2 hours
2. **Fix & Test:** Root cause analysis, fix implementation, automated tests added
3. **Fix Release Branch First:** Fix applied to release branch, then forward-ported to main (see [Bug Fix Workflow](#33-code-freeze-mechanics))
   - Create PR to release branch with bug ticket linked
   - Bug ticket stays open until main is also fixed
   - Developer and Release Owner verify both PRs merged
4. **New RC:** Cut new release candidate (e.g., v1.5.0-rc.3)
5. **Regression Testing:** Full test suite re-run
6. **Time Box:** If fix takes > 24 hours, consider release delay or degrading severity

**For Major bugs:**
1. **Before Code Freeze:** Major severity bugs must be fixed before GA release
   - **Release Owner Assessment:** Evaluate impact, risk, complexity, and timeline
   - **Fix & Include:** Implement fix in release branch, forward-port to main (see [Bug Fix Workflow](#33-code-freeze-mechanics))
   - **If Not Fixable in Timeline:**
     - Consider release delay to allow fix completion
     - OR downgrade severity if impact assessment justifies (requires stakeholder approval and documented rationale)
2. **During Code Freeze:** Major bugs must be either:
   - **Escalated to Critical:** With documented justification showing blocker-level impact to be included in the release
   - **Deferred to Next Patch:** Scheduled for the next patch release (e.g., v1.5.1) if impact does not warrant Critical escalation

**For Normal/Minor bugs:**
- Default: Defer to next patch release or next minor release
- Track in backlog for future releases

### 5.3 Post-Code Freeze PR Approval Process

All PRs to release branch after code freeze require:

1. **Justification:** PR description must include:
   - Bug severity and impact
   - Why fix cannot wait for patch release
   - Risk assessment (What could break?)
   - Test coverage added/modified

2. **Approval Chain:**
   ```text
   Developer → Code Review → Release Owner → Automated Tests → Merge
   ```
   - Minimum 2 approvals (1 technical reviewer + Release Owner)
   - Prow tests must be green
   - No approval bypasses allowed

3. **Communication:**
   - Post to release Slack channel for visibility
   - Update release ticket
   - Notify stakeholders if fix delays GA timeline

### 5.4 Hotfix Workflow (Post-GA)

For bugs discovered after GA release:

```bash
# Example assumes hyperfleet-sentinel component (v1.4.x)
# Create hotfix branch from component release tag
git checkout -b hotfix-1.4.3 v1.4.2

# Make fix, test, commit
git commit -m "Fix critical bug in hyperfleet-sentinel component"

# Merge to release branch
git checkout release-1.4
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.4.3

# Tag component patch release
git tag -a v1.4.3 -m "Patch release v1.4.3"
git push origin release-1.4 --tags

# Forward-port to main if applicable (same bug ticket)
git checkout main
# Apply fix manually OR cherry-pick if clean
# Bug ticket stays open until both release and main are fixed
```

**Hotfix Release Timeline:**
- Blocker/Critical severity: Patch release within 48 hours
- Major severity: Patch release within 1 week

### 5.5 Release Recovery Strategy

**HyperFleet uses a roll-forward recovery strategy for MVP releases.**

#### 5.5.1 Roll-Forward (Primary Strategy)

When issues are discovered in a GA release, the default recovery path is to **fix forward** via a patch release:

**Process:**
1. Fix the issue in release branch first (link bug ticket)
2. Forward-port fix to main (same bug ticket, stays open until both merged)
3. Cut patch release (e.g., v1.5.0 → v1.5.1)
4. Deploy patch following standard deployment procedures
5. Verify forward-port completion (both developer and Release Owner)

**Timeline:**
- Blocker/Critical: Patch release within 48 hours
- Major: Patch release within 1 week

**Advantages:**
- Simpler testing scope (only test the fix)
- No database migration reversal complexity
- Maintains forward version progression
- Faster response for critical issues

#### 5.5.2 Rollback Support (Post-MVP)

**Status:** Deferred to Post-Q1 (separate epic required)

**Reference:** See [versioning trade-offs documentation](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/docs/versioning-trade-offs.md#4-database-migration-and-rollback-procedures-post-mvp) for detailed rollback considerations.

**Decision Point:** Evaluate rollback support necessity after MVP based on:
- Incident frequency and severity
- Customer requirements for rollback capabilities
- Database schema stability
- Testing infrastructure maturity

---

## 6. Release Cadence

**Regular Releases:** TBD - to be determined by Tech Lead after initial releases
- **Weeks 1-2 (TBD by Tech Lead)**: Active development
- **End of Week 2 (TBD by Tech Lead)**: Release Readiness Review (go/no-go decision)
- **Week 3 (TBD by Tech Lead, estimated 5 working days)**:
  - Day 1: Feature freeze, create release branches
  - Days 1-3: Stabilization and testing
  - Days 4-5: Code freeze, final validation
  - End of Day 5: GA release
  - Note: Timeline can be adjusted based on actual circumstances

**Ad-Hoc Releases:** As needed for urgent requirements (3-5 working days)
- Triggers: Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, urgent business needs
- Reduced testing scope (unit, integration, E2E for affected components only)
- Release Owner approval required

**Cadence Refinement:**
- Revisit cadence after every several releases during retrospectives
- Adjust based on team capacity, automation maturity, and quality metrics

---

## 7. Release Artifacts and Deliverables

### 7.0 Release Repository

**Create: `openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-release` repository**

A dedicated release repository serves as the single source of truth for all HyperFleet releases.

**Purpose:**
- Centralized release notes, installation guides, and upgrade documentation
- Defines validated component version combinations for each HyperFleet Release
- Release tracking issues and automation scripts
- User-facing documentation via GitHub Pages (optional)

**What goes in the release repository:**
- HyperFleet Release tags: `release-1.5`, `release-1.6` (marking validated component combinations)
- Release notes for each HyperFleet Release (`releases/release-1.5/release-notes.md`)
- Compatibility matrix for each release (which component versions work together)
- Installation and upgrade guides
- Links to component container images and artifacts
- Aggregated changelog from all components
- Release automation scripts

**What stays in component repositories:**
- Source code
- Component-specific git tags (e.g., `v1.5.0`, `v1.4.2`, `v2.0.0`)
- Component-specific Helm charts
- Component-specific CHANGELOGs
- Development documentation

**Benefits:** Single location for offering team to find all release information, clear component version combinations for each release, cleaner separation between component development and integrated release artifacts.

### 7.1 Primary Release Artifacts

**Container Images:**
- Built automatically by Prow on release tag creation
- Published to `quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-*`
- **Image naming:** Each component uses its own independent semantic version
  ```text
  quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-{component}:v{component-version}
  ```
  - `hyperfleet-api` for hyperfleet-api
  - `hyperfleet-sentinel` for hyperfleet-sentinel
  - `hyperfleet-adapter` for hyperfleet-adapter
- **Example for HyperFleet Release 1.5:**
  - `quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-api:v1.5.0`
  - `quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-sentinel:v1.4.2`
  - `quay.io/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-adapter:v2.0.0`

  (Each component has its own version reflecting its actual changes per [Versioning Strategy](#35-versioning-strategy))

**Helm Charts:**
- Each component has its own Helm chart in component repositories
  - Note: hyperfleet-adapter base chart is designed for overlay usage by business adapters, not standalone deployment
- Note: Umbrella chart strategy (hyperfleet-chart repo) is under discussion

**Git Tags:**
- Git tags created independently in component repositories: `vX.Y.Z` (reflecting each component's version)
- HyperFleet Release tag created in `openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-release` repository: `release-X.Y` (single source of truth for the validated component combination - see [Release Repository](#70-release-repository))
- GitHub Releases created from tags with release notes and compatibility matrix

**Execution checklist:** See [GA Release - Tag GA Release](#16-phase-5-ga-release)

### 7.3 Compliance and Security Artifacts

**MVP:**
- Vulnerability scanning of container images
- No CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs in release

**Post-MVP (with Konflux):**
- Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement
- SBOM generation
- SLSA Level 3 provenance
- Image signing with Sigstore/Cosign

---

## 8. Konflux vs. Prow Comparison

### 8.1 Current State: Prow

**What Works:**
- Automated CI/CD pipeline (testing, image builds)
- GitHub integration
- Team familiarity

**What's Missing:**
- SLSA provenance, SBOM generation, image signing
- Requires additional tooling for supply chain security

### 8.2 Konflux Benefits

**Supply Chain Security:**
- SLSA Level 3 provenance, SBOM, Sigstore signing (built-in)
- **Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement**
- Integrated vulnerability scanning

**Release Automation:**
- Unified build-test-release workflow
- OCI artifact management
- Policy-as-code compliance gates

### 8.3 Recommendation

**MVP Approach:**
- **Use Prow + manual release process**
- Manual steps: branching, tagging, Helm packaging, GitHub Releases
- Defer security tooling to Post-MVP
- Focus: Establish process first, automate later

**Post-MVP Migration:**
- Migrate to Konflux for automated releases
- Add Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement

## 9. Next Steps

### 9.1 MVP Tickets (First Release Preparation)

**[TICKET-1] Create HyperFleet Releases Repository**
- **Objective:** Set up `openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-release` as single source of truth
- **Tasks:**
  - Initialize repository structure (release notes, docs, charts)
  - Set up issue templates for release tracking and ad-hoc requests
  - Document repository purpose and usage in README
- **Reference:** [Release Artifacts and Deliverables](#7-release-artifacts-and-deliverables)

**[TICKET-2] Establish Release Cadence and Calendar**
- **Objective:** Define release schedule to meet first release
- **Tasks:**
  - Decide first release date and version number
  - Publish release calendar for next 3 months (including first release)
  - Document ad-hoc release criteria and process
  - Communicate calendar to team and stakeholders
- **Reference:** [Release Cadence](#6-release-cadence)

**[TICKET-3] Prepare for First Release**
- **Objective:** Document procedures and assign ownership for first release
- **Tasks:**
  - Write runbook: Release branching, tagging, image promotion
  - Write runbook: Helm chart packaging and GitHub Release creation
  - Finalize release checklist
  - Assign Release Owner for first release
  - Document Release Owner responsibilities (gatekeeper, approver)
  - Plan rotation strategy for future releases
- **Reference:** [Release Entry Criteria](#2-release-entry-criteria), [Code Freeze and Branching Strategy](#3-code-freeze-and-branching-strategy), [Release Artifacts and Deliverables](#7-release-artifacts-and-deliverables)

**[TICKET-4] Execute First Release**
- **Objective:** Run first release following documented process
- **Tasks:**
  - Create `release-v{X.Y}` branch at feature freeze
  - Cut Release Candidate (RC.1)
  - Execute full testing suite as defined in [Testing & Validation](#41-testing--validation-mandatory)
  - Fix bugs in release branch first, forward-port to main if needed (follow [Bug Handling Workflow](#5-bug-handling-workflow-after-code-freeze) process)
  - Cut final GA release
  - Publish release artifacts and documentation
  - Conduct post-release retrospective
- **Reference:** [Release Entry Criteria](#2-release-entry-criteria), [Code Freeze and Branching Strategy](#3-code-freeze-and-branching-strategy), [Release Artifacts and Deliverables](#7-release-artifacts-and-deliverables)

### 9.2 Post-MVP Improvements

#### 9.2.1 Conduct Retrospectives and Identify Improvements

After completing the first few releases with manual processes, conduct retrospectives to:
- Identify workflow pain points and bottlenecks
- Determine which manual steps should be automated
- Evaluate release process effectiveness (timing, quality gates, coordination)
- Gather feedback from Release Owners, developers, and stakeholders
- Update release procedures based on lessons learned
- Prioritize automation opportunities (Helm packaging, release notes generation, GitHub Releases)

#### 9.2.2 Migrate to Konflux for Official Releases

Transition from manual Prow-based releases to Konflux for production-grade, compliant releases:

##### Why Konflux

- **Enterprise Contract Policy** enforcement for compliance and security gates
- Makes releases more official with built-in governance
- SLSA Level 3 compliance (provenance, SBOM, signing)
- Unified build-test-release pipeline with policy-as-code

##### Migration Approach

- Evaluate Konflux with pilot project (test environment, parallel builds with Prow)
- Implement Enterprise Contract Policy framework and define policies
- Migrate all components to Konflux pipelines
- Automate SBOM generation, image signing, and provenance
- Full cutover after validation

#### 9.2.3 Additional Process Improvements

Based on retrospective findings and Konflux capabilities:
- Establish automated E2E test gate as mandatory release criteria
- Create release health monitoring dashboards
- Define SLI/SLO framework for release quality metrics
- Optimize release cadence based on data (6-month review)
- Consider LTS release designation (e.g., every 4th release)

### 9.3 Success Metrics

**Track and review quarterly:**

**Release Metrics:**
- HyperFleet Release frequency (cadence TBD by Tech Lead based on team capacity and automation maturity)
- Component patch release frequency (individual component updates between HyperFleet Releases)
- Code freeze duration (target: < 1 week, ideally 3-5 days)
- On-time delivery (target: > 80% of HyperFleet Releases on schedule)
- Stabilization phase variance (track actual vs. planned to inform process improvements)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Bug escape rate (bugs found post-GA per component and per HyperFleet Release)
- Hotfix frequency per component (target: < 2 patch releases per component between HyperFleet Releases)
- Mean time to patch critical vulnerabilities (target: < 48 hours for any component)
- Cross-component compatibility issues found in production (target: 0)
