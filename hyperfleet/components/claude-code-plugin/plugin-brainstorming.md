# HyperFleet Claude Code Plugins - Brainstorming Proposal

**Date**: 2025-11-27 (Initial), 2025-12-02 (Updated)
**Status**: Updated with JIRA Enhancement Details
**Goal**: Design practical Claude Code plugins for the HyperFleet project

---

## Background

HyperFleet Core Architecture Overview:

### What is HyperFleet?
HyperFleet is an event-driven, cloud-agnostic cluster lifecycle management platform for automating OpenShift cluster creation, configuration, and management.

### Core Components
1. **HyperFleet API** - RESTful API providing CRUD operations for cluster resources
2. **Sentinel** - Polls API, decides when to trigger reconciliation, publishes CloudEvents
3. **Message Broker** - Message distribution (Pub/Sub, SQS, RabbitMQ)
4. **Adapters** - Event-driven services executing specific tasks (DNS, validation, control plane, etc.)
5. **Database** - PostgreSQL storing cluster state and adapter state

### Key Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture** - Sentinel publishes events, Adapters consume
- **Anemic Events Pattern** - Events contain minimal information, adapters fetch complete data from API
- **Config-Driven Adapters** - Single binary deployed as multiple adapter types through different configurations
- **Condition-Based Status** - Kubernetes-style condition reporting (Available, Applied, Health)
- **Versioning Strategy** - Semantic versioning, independent version management for API/Sentinel/Adapter

### Existing Claude Code Plugin Infrastructure
- Existing marketplace framework: `openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-claude-plugins`
- Supports 5 plugin types: Commands, Agents, Skills, Hooks, MCP Servers
- Team is already using Claude Code
- **Existing Plugins**:
  - `hyperfleet-architecture` - Architecture documentation query skill
  - `hyperfleet-jira` - JIRA integration (ticket creation, sprint management, hygiene checks, story points estimation)

---

## Plugin Design Principles

To ensure plugins focus on true value, the following principles guide the evaluation and selection of plugin ideas:

**✅ Should Do**:
1. **External systems Claude cannot directly access** (JIRA, Slack, Google Meeting)
2. **Project-specific complex business logic** (dependency analysis, requirement validation)
3. **High-frequency operations requiring optimization** (card validation, epic planning)
4. **Cross-repo/cross-team content distribution** (AI Templates)

**❌ Should Not Do**:
1. Duplicate Claude's core capabilities
2. Simple script execution
3. Standardized needs solvable with template/context
4. Functionality achievable through existing plugin combinations

**These principles guide the subsequent screening and design of plugin ideas.**

---

## Claude Code Plugin Brainstorming

Based on HyperFleet's architectural characteristics, development workflow, and the above design principles, here are the initially screened Plugin ideas:

### Category 1: Architecture and Design Assistance

#### 1.1 AI Templates (Skill + Command Plugin)
**Plugin Type**: Skill + Commands (Hybrid)
**Purpose**: Unified prompt templates to reduce repetitive work and ensure team consistency

**Problem**: Writing prompts is repetitive and painful. Copying templates across repos leads to maintenance nightmares. Need team-wide best practices.

**Solution**: Single source of truth in marketplace repo. Hybrid approach using Commands for quick tasks and Skills for complex analysis.

**Core Templates** (examples):

**Commands** (quick, deterministic):
1. **commit-message** - Generate Conventional Commit messages (forces git diff input instead of conversation history)
2. **pr-description** - Generate structured PR descriptions (forces git log input instead of conversation history)

**Skills** (interactive, context-aware):
3. **architecture-analyzer** - Generates architecture impact analysis plan
   - Analyzes code changes and their architectural implications
   - Identifies affected components and potential risks
4. **multi-perspective-reviewer** - Multi-role perspective document review
   - Analyzes documents from Developer, End User, QA, Product Manager, Architect perspectives
   - Standardizes review process and output format
   - Ensures documents consider different stakeholder concerns

**Value**: Cross-repo distribution, team consistency, high-frequency optimization

---

#### 1.2 Adapter Config Assistant (Skill Plugin)
**Plugin Type**: Skill
**Purpose**: Comprehensive adapter configuration lifecycle tool - generation, intelligent expression creation, validation, and analysis
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem Background**:
- Writing adapter configs requires deep understanding of CEL expressions and HyperFleet semantics
- Complex preconditions and resource expressions are error-prone
- Difficult to understand and debug existing adapter configurations
- Need to simulate adapter behavior before deployment to catch edge cases

**Solution**:
Comprehensive plugin that handles the complete adapter configuration lifecycle - from initial template generation to intelligent CEL expression creation, validation, explanation, and behavior simulation.

**Core Capabilities** (3 integrated features):

##### Capability 1: Smart Template Generation
- Interactive prompting for adapter parameters (name, provider, event type, dependencies)
- Generates complete YAML skeleton conforming to adapter config schema
- Provides best-practice defaults and common patterns

**Example Output**:
```yaml
apiVersion: hyperfleet.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdapterConfig
metadata:
  name: dns-adapter
spec:
  provider: gcp
  eventTypes:
    - cluster.created
    - cluster.updated
  preconditions:
    - # Generated based on dependencies
  resources:
    - # Generated based on adapter type
  statusReporting:
    conditions:
      - type: Applied
      - type: Available
```

##### Capability 2: Intelligent CEL Expression Generation
Convert natural language requirements into syntactically correct CEL expressions and precondition YAML.

**Common Patterns**:
- Phase checks: `cluster.status.phase in ['Provisioning', 'Ready']`
- Condition checks: `cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'DNSReady' && c.status == 'True')`
- Dependency validation, field validations (null, type, range checks)
- Complete precondition blocks with explanations

**Example Interaction**:
```yaml
User: I need to check cluster phase is Provisioning or Ready, and DNS and Validation adapters are both complete

AI: I'll generate the precondition YAML with CEL expressions for you:

preconditions:
  - name: check-cluster-phase-and-dependencies
    expression: |
      cluster.status.phase in ['Provisioning', 'Ready'] &&
      cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'DNSReady' && c.status == 'True') &&
      cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'ValidationComplete' && c.status == 'True')
    message: "Cluster must be in Provisioning or Ready phase with DNS and Validation complete"

Explanation:
- Phase check: cluster.status.phase in ['Provisioning', 'Ready']
  → Passes when cluster phase is either Provisioning or Ready
- DNS check: cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'DNSReady' && c.status == 'True')
  → Passes when there's a condition of type DNSReady with status True
- Validation check: cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'ValidationComplete' && c.status == 'True')
  → Passes when there's a condition of type ValidationComplete with status True

All three conditions must be true (&&) for the precondition to pass.
```

##### Capability 3: Configuration Validation & Analysis
Validate, explain, and simulate existing adapter configurations.

**Sub-Capabilities**:
- **Validation**: CEL syntax checking, field reference validation, logic consistency, best practices
- **Explanation**: Explain precondition pass/fail scenarios, resource creation triggers, status reporting logic
- **Simulation**: Predict adapter behavior given input events, identify edge cases

**Validation Example**:
```text
User: Validate this precondition:
  expression: cluster.status.phase == 'Ready' && cluster.status.phase == 'Provisioning'

AI: ❌ Validation Error Found:
  Line: cluster.status.phase == 'Ready' && cluster.status.phase == 'Provisioning'
  Issue: Contradictory condition - phase cannot be both 'Ready' AND 'Provisioning' simultaneously
  Suggestion: Use OR instead: cluster.status.phase in ['Ready', 'Provisioning']
```

**Explanation Example**:
```text
User: What does this precondition mean?
  expression: |
    cluster.spec.provider == 'gcp' &&
    cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'ValidationComplete' && c.status == 'True') &&
    has(cluster.spec.network.dnsZone)

AI: This precondition checks three requirements:

1. Provider Check (cluster.spec.provider == 'gcp')
   ✅ Passes when: Cluster provider is GCP
   ❌ Fails when: Provider is AWS, Azure, or any other value

2. Validation Dependency (cluster.status.conditions.exists(...))
   ✅ Passes when: ValidationComplete condition exists with status=True
   ❌ Fails when: Validation not complete, or condition doesn't exist

3. DNS Zone Presence (has(cluster.spec.network.dnsZone))
   ✅ Passes when: dnsZone field is defined (not null/missing)
   ❌ Fails when: dnsZone field is missing or null

Overall Behavior:
- This precondition will PASS only when all three conditions are met
- This is typically used by adapters that need to configure GCP DNS after validation completes
- If any condition fails, the adapter will skip processing this event
```

**Simulation Example**:
```text
User: Simulate this adapter config with a cluster in phase=Provisioning, provider=gcp, but no ValidationComplete condition

AI: Simulation Results:

Input State:
- cluster.status.phase = "Provisioning"
- cluster.spec.provider = "gcp"
- cluster.status.conditions = [] (empty)

Precondition Evaluation:
✅ cluster.spec.provider == 'gcp' → PASS
❌ cluster.status.conditions.exists(c, c.type == 'ValidationComplete' && c.status == 'True') → FAIL
  Reason: No conditions exist yet

Overall Precondition: FAIL

Adapter Behavior:
❌ Adapter will NOT process this event
- Precondition blocks execution
- No resources will be created
- Adapter will report: Waiting for ValidationComplete condition

Edge Cases Identified:
⚠️ Edge Case 1: What if ValidationComplete condition exists but status='False'?
  → Precondition will still FAIL (requires status='True')

⚠️ Edge Case 2: What if multiple ValidationComplete conditions exist?
  → exists() returns true if ANY match, so PASS if at least one has status='True'

Recommendation:
Wait for the Validation adapter to complete and set the ValidationComplete condition to True.
```

**Value**:
- ✅ **High-frequency operation** - Every adapter development cycle involves config creation/modification
- ✅ **Complex domain logic** - CEL expressions + HyperFleet semantics require expertise
- ✅ **Reduce errors** - Catch syntax and logic errors before deployment
- ✅ **Accelerate onboarding** - New developers understand adapter configs faster
- ✅ **Improve quality** - Identify edge cases and logic issues proactively

---

### Category 2: Integration and Automation
**Plugin Type**: Skill (Enhance existing `hyperfleet-jira` plugin)

- [ ] @bob Research TypeSpec (by next Monday)

### Unresolved Issues
- Adapter backward compatibility strategy still needs discussion
```

---

#### 2.3 Local Development Environment Deployer (Agent Plugin)
**Plugin Type**: Agent
**Purpose**: Simplify local deployment of complete HyperFleet development environment, allowing developers to validate code changes before submitting PRs

**Core Functionality**:

1. **Environment Preparation**
   - Verify local k8s environment is accessible (GKE, EKS, AKS, kind, minikube, or other k8s clusters)
   - Validate kubectl connectivity

2. **Deploy Complete HyperFleet Framework**
   - Clone umbrella helm chart repo
   - helm install all components:
     * HyperFleet API
     * Sentinel
     * Message Broker (Pub/Sub simulator / RabbitMQ)
     * Database (PostgreSQL)
     * Sample adapters (validation, dns, etc.)
   - Wait for all components ready

3. **Intelligent Code Injection**
   - Auto-detect current working directory component type (API? Adapter? Sentinel?)
   - Build local container image using podman (using local changes)
   - kubectl set image to update corresponding deployment
   - Wait for pod ready and verify health status

4. **Execute End-to-End Validation**
   - Run smoke tests (key subset of E2E tests, not full suite to save time)
   - Verify core flow:
     * Create test cluster via API
     * Verify Sentinel publishes event
     * Verify Adapter receives and processes event
     * Verify status updates correctly (phase, conditions)
   - Run component-specific integration tests (if exist)

5. **AI-Assisted Analysis and Reporting**
   - Deployment status (all components healthy?)
   - Test results summary (pass/fail, detailed logs)
   - Performance metrics (event latency, API response time)
   - If failed, provide debugging guidance and relevant logs
   - Suggest next steps

6. **Environment Management**
   - **Preserve environment** after validation for developer debugging
   - Provide cleanup command: "/cleanup-local" to delete all created resources
   - Support re-running validation without redeploying environment

**Trigger Methods** (On-Demand Only, NOT Automatic):
- **This plugin is triggered ONLY when user explicitly requests it**
- Command: `/deploy-local` - User manually executes when ready to validate
- Command: `/cleanup-local` - Cleanup environment
- Skill: "Deploy and validate my local changes"
- Skill: "Cleanup local HyperFleet environment"

**Typical Workflow**:
1. Developer writes code locally (may involve multiple iterations with AI assistance)
2. Developer continues debugging and refining code (NOT triggering deployment)
3. When developer is ready to validate, **manually execute** `/deploy-local`
4. Plugin deploys environment, applies local code, runs validation
5. Developer can continue debugging, re-run validation as needed
6. After validation passes, developer executes `/cleanup-local` to clean up environment

**Use Cases**:
- Quick validation before PR submission
- Integration testing after new adapter development
- Compatibility validation after API changes
- Quick reproduction and debugging of production issues
- Learning HyperFleet architecture (by deploying complete environment)

---

### Category 3: Debugging and Troubleshooting

#### 3.1 HyperFleet System Debugger (Agent Plugin)
**Plugin Type**: Agent
**Purpose**: When encountering a HyperFleet issue, trace the complete event flow (API → Sentinel → Broker → Adapter → K8s) and collect relevant logs to identify where the problem occurred
**Invocation**: `@Claude debug hyperfleet issue: <description>`

**Debug Flow** (Following HyperFleet Architecture):
When you report an issue (e.g., "cluster cls-123 stuck in provisioning"), the plugin traces the complete reconciliation flow:

1. **Check API Layer**
   - Query resource status: `GET /api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/cls-123`
   - Check spec and status fields (generation, observed_generation, conditions)
   - Look for API errors in logs related to this resource

2. **Check Sentinel Decision**
   - Verify if Sentinel is polling this resource
   - Check decision logic: generation mismatch? max age expired?
   - Find Sentinel logs about event publishing for this resource
   - Verify last event time vs current time

3. **Check Message Broker**
   - Verify events were published to broker
   - Check if messages are stuck in queue
   - Look for broker connection errors

4. **Check Adapter Processing**
   - For each relevant adapter (Validation, DNS, Placement, HyperShift):
     - Did adapter receive the event?
     - Did preconditions pass or fail? (spec.provider, dependencies)
     - What status did adapter report? (Applied, Available, Health)
     - Any errors during execution?
   - Find adapter logs for this resource ID

5. **Check Kubernetes Resources** (if applicable)
   - Did adapter create K8s resources?
   - Are resources healthy?
   - Any pod errors or crashes?

**Use Cases**:
- "Why is cluster cls-123 stuck in provisioning?"
- "Why didn't DNS adapter update cluster cls-456?"
- "Why is Sentinel not publishing events?"
- "API request failed - what happened?"

**Output Example**:
```text
HyperFleet Debug Report - cluster cls-123
==========================================
Issue: Cluster stuck in "provisioning" state

=== 1. API Layer ===
✅ Resource exists
   Spec: generation=2, provider=gcp, region=us-east1
   Status: observed_generation=1 (MISMATCH!)
   Phase: Provisioning
   Last updated: 10 minutes ago

=== 2. Sentinel Decision ===
⚠️ Potential Issue Found
   Sentinel logs (last 5 minutes):
   - "Evaluated cluster cls-123: generation mismatch (2 > 1) → should publish event"
   - "Published event for cls-123 to broker"
   Last event time: 8 minutes ago

=== 3. Message Broker ===
✅ Event delivered
   Topic: hyperfleet.clusters
   Message delivered to 4 subscribers

=== 4. Adapter Processing ===
✅ Validation Adapter
   - Received event at 14:25:03
   - Preconditions: PASSED
   - Status reported: Applied=True, Available=True

⚠️ DNS Adapter - ISSUE FOUND
   - Received event at 14:25:04
   - Error log: "Failed to create DNS record: PERMISSION_DENIED"
   - Status: Applied=False, Available=False
   - Last error (14:25:05): "GCP Service Account lacks dns.managedZones.create permission"

✅ Placement Adapter
   - Skipped (precondition failed: DNS not available)

❌ HyperShift Adapter
   - Skipped (precondition failed: DNS not available)

=== Root Cause ===
DNS Adapter failed due to GCP permission issue. This blocks downstream adapters.

=== Recommended Actions ===
1. Grant DNS permissions to service account:
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
     --member=serviceAccount:dns-adapter@PROJECT.iam \
     --role=roles/dns.admin

2. Verify permission:
   kubectl logs -n hyperfleet-system deployment/dns-adapter | grep PERMISSION

3. Sentinel will auto-retry in ~10 seconds (not-ready max age)
```

**Value**:
- Trace complete event flow across all HyperFleet components
- Quickly identify which component is blocking progress
- Collect relevant logs without manually checking each component
- Understand adapter dependency chain (why downstream adapters are skipped)

---

#### 3.2 Event Flow Tracer (Agent Plugin)
**Plugin Type**: Agent
**Purpose**: Visualize event flow timeline and analyze performance metrics to understand system behavior and identify bottlenecks
**Invocation**: `@Claude trace event flow for <resource-id>` or `@Claude analyze event flow performance`

**Focus**: Performance analysis and observability (not problem diagnosis)

**Capabilities**:

1. **Event Timeline Visualization**
   - Generate timeline showing event propagation through the system
   - Timestamps for each stage: Sentinel decision → Broker publish → Adapter receive → Adapter complete
   - Identify delays between stages

2. **Performance Metrics**
   - Event processing latency (end-to-end time)
   - Per-stage latency (Sentinel → Broker: Xms, Broker → Adapter: Yms)
   - Adapter processing time breakdown
   - Compare against baseline/SLO

3. **Pattern Analysis**
   - Analyze multiple events to find patterns
   - Identify consistently slow adapters
   - Detect event storms or backlog buildup
   - Spot unusual delays or anomalies

4. **Throughput Analysis**
   - Events processed per minute
   - Broker queue depth trends
   - Adapter concurrency utilization

**Output Example**:
```text
Event Flow Performance Analysis - cluster cls-123
==================================================

=== Timeline Visualization ===
14:25:00.000 ┃ Sentinel: Decision (generation mismatch detected)
14:25:00.050 ┃ └─→ Broker: Event published (+50ms)
14:25:00.100 ┃     └─→ Fanout to 4 adapters (+50ms)
14:25:00.120 ┃         ├─→ Validation Adapter received (+20ms)
14:25:00.320 ┃         │   └─→ Completed (+200ms processing)
14:25:00.125 ┃         ├─→ DNS Adapter received (+25ms)
14:25:05.425 ┃         │   └─→ Completed (+5.3s processing) ⚠️ SLOW
14:25:00.130 ┃         ├─→ Placement Adapter received (+30ms)
14:25:00.130 ┃         │   └─→ Skipped (precondition failed)
14:25:00.135 ┃         └─→ HyperShift Adapter received (+35ms)
14:25:00.135 ┃             └─→ Skipped (precondition failed)

=== Latency Breakdown ===
Stage                         | Latency  | Status
------------------------------|----------|--------
Sentinel Decision             | baseline | ✅
Sentinel → Broker             | 50ms     | ✅ (SLO: <100ms)
Broker → Adapters             | 50ms     | ✅ (SLO: <100ms)
Validation Adapter Processing | 200ms    | ✅ (SLO: <500ms)
DNS Adapter Processing        | 5.3s     | ⚠️ SLOW (SLO: <1s, exceeded by 4.3s)

Total event flow latency: 5.425s

=== Performance Insights ===
⚠️ Bottleneck Identified: DNS Adapter
   - Processing time: 5.3s (430% over SLO)
   - Likely cause: External GCP DNS API calls
   - Recommendation: Review DNS adapter implementation for optimization

✅ Broker Performance: Normal
   - Fanout latency: 50ms (within SLO)
   - Queue depth: 3 messages (healthy)

=== Comparison with Recent Events ===
Last 10 events for DNS Adapter:
   - Average processing time: 4.8s
   - P95: 6.2s
   - P99: 8.1s
   → Consistently slow, not an anomaly

Suggested Actions:
1. Profile DNS Adapter to identify slow operations
2. Consider caching DNS lookups
3. Review GCP DNS API quotas and rate limits
```

**Value**:
- Understand event flow performance characteristics
- Identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Validate system meets latency SLOs
- Proactive performance monitoring (before issues occur)
- Different from System Debugger: focuses on "how fast" not "why broken"

## Summary

After review and streamlining, this brainstorming session proposes **7 Claude Code Plugin ideas**, divided into **3 major categories**:

1. **Architecture and Design Assistance** (2) - AI Templates (including adapter-config template), Adapter Config Assistant
2. **Integration and Automation** (3) - JIRA Integration Enhancement, Slack Discussion Summarizer, Local Development Environment Deployer
3. **Debugging and Troubleshooting** (2) - HyperFleet System Debugger, Event Flow Tracer

All plugins follow the **design principles** defined at the beginning of the document, focusing on functionality that truly provides incremental value, adhering to the "less is more" principle.
